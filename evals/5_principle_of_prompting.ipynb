      "Genius models may soon revolutionize the workplace, but don't kid yourself‚Äîprompt engineering isn't going anywhere. Think of it like telling a prodigy how to behave at a family dinner; even the smartest among us need a nudge from HR or legal to keep in line with the business strategy. And if you think you can just sit back and let the algorithm work, consider this: a staggering 70% of AI initiatives in businesses flop due to a lack of alignment with objectives. So, refine those prompts, folks‚Äîbecause even in the world of AI, it‚Äôs still all about the right directions.\n",
