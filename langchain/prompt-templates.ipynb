      "In programming, the terms \"function\" and \"method\" are often used interchangeably, but they refer to slightly different concepts, particularly in the context of object-oriented programming.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Function:\n",
      "- A **function** is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. It is defined using a name and can be called from anywhere in the program.\n",
      "- Functions can take input arguments and can return a value.\n",
      "- Functions are not necessarily associated with any object or class, and they exist independently.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example in Python:**\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def add(a, b):\n",
      "    return a + b\n",
      "\n",
      "result = add(2, 3)  # This calls the function 'add'\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Method:\n",
      "- A **method** is a function that is associated with an object or class. In other words, methods are functions that belong to an instance of a class or the class itself.\n",
      "- Methods can access and modify the data contained within the class (attributes) as well as perform operations related to the class.\n",
      "- They are called on an object and usually take the `self` parameter (in Python) which refers to the instance of the class.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example in Python:**\n",
      "```python\n",
      "class Calculator:\n",
      "    def add(self, a, b):\n",
      "        return a + b\n",
      "\n",
      "calc = Calculator()  # Creating an instance of the class\n",
      "result = calc.add(2, 3)  # This calls the method 'add'\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Summary:\n",
      "- **Functions** are standalone and can be called without any object reference.\n",
      "- **Methods** are functions that operate within the context of a class and can manipulate the class's data. \n",
      "\n",
      "Understanding the distinction between the two is important for object-oriented programming and helps in organizing and structuring code more efficiently.\n"
