The constraints based on flour and sugar are: 2x + 3y <= 200 (for flour) and x + 2y <= 150 (for sugar). The profit function to maximize is P = 5x + 8y. To find the maximum profit, we can solve the inequalities: 1. From 2x + 3y <= 200, we can express y in terms of x: y <= (200 - 2x)/3. 2. From x + 2y <= 150, we can express y in terms of x: y <= (150 - x)/2. We will graph these inequalities to find the feasible region. The vertices of the feasible region will give us the potential maximum profits. The vertices can be found by solving the equations where the lines intersect: 2x + 3y = 200 and x + 2y = 150. Solving these gives us the points (0, 66.67), (100, 0), and (60, 30). Evaluating the profit function at these points: At (0, 66.67): P = 5(0) + 8(66.67) = 533.36; At (100, 0): P = 5(100) + 8(0) = 500; At (60, 30): P = 5(60) + 8(30) = 660.

The constraints based on the available ingredients can be expressed as follows: For flour, 2x + 3y ≤ 200, and for sugar, x + 2y ≤ 150. The profit function to maximize is P = 5x + 8y. We will first find the feasible region defined by the constraints. 1. From the flour constraint: 2x + 3y ≤ 200. If x=0, y=66.67; if y=0, x=100. 2. From the sugar constraint: x + 2y ≤ 150. If x=0, y=75; if y=0, x=150. Now we will find the intersection points of these lines. Setting 2x + 3y = 200 and x + 2y = 150, we can solve these equations simultaneously to find the intersection points. Solving gives us x = 30, y = 45. The feasible corner points to check for maximum profit are (0, 75), (100, 0), (30, 45), and the intercepts. Evaluating the profit function at these points: P(0, 75) = 5(0) + 8(75) = 600; P(100, 0) = 5(100) + 8(0) = 500; P(30, 45) = 5(30) + 8(45) = 150 + 360 = 510.
