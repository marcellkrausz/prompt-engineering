# Prompt Engineering Practice

Welcome to the **Prompt Engineering Practice** repository! This project serves as a collection of my personal experiments, exercises, and learning journey in prompt engineering, implemented in Python.

## What is Prompt Engineering?

Prompt engineering is the process of designing and crafting effective prompts to interact with AI models like GPT to get optimal responses. The goal is to improve the understanding of how different prompt structures influence model behavior and responses, enhancing the user experience and model output.

## Purpose

This repository is intended to document my practice and experiments in crafting prompts for various AI models. It contains various attempts at improving the results of AI-driven text generation, with a focus on learning how to better communicate and guide AI models to produce the most relevant and accurate outputs.

## Installation:

- Install gitleaks for secret scanning: `brew install gitleaks`
- Install pre-commit: `pip install pre-commit`
- Install pre-commit hooks: `pre-commit install`

## How to run Gitleaks to generate a report:

`gitleaks detect --source="." --report-path="gitleaks-report.json"`
