Michelle,13,"I: Let's begin with ‚how I see myself'. Can you just go through the pictures that you've 
used and explain what pictures you'
ve used and why you've used them? 
M: Yeah. I've used this woman [Kelly Ro
wland ] b ecau se sh e's quite fashionable and I 
see myself as a fashionable person. I' ve used a picture of a Liverpool football team 

because I see myself as quite a supportive pers
on towards the team. I put a love heart 
because I'm quite a loving person. I also 
put a laptop because I like to explore things 
and try new things. 
I: What about the pictures of Kat, Alfie [
EastEnders
 characters] and, is that Lemar? 
M: Bow Wow. 
I: Let's start with Kat and Alfie, why have you used them? 

M: Because Kat, erm Alfie's quite cheery and he makes people smile so metimes so I just 
like Alfie, and I also have a temper to so I put Kat. 
I: And what about Bow Wow? 
M: I put him because I like him (laughs). 
I: So if you were going to sum up how you see yourself, what words would you use that 
the pictures are trying to express? 
M: Creative, fashionable, quite a happy pe
rson, quite tempered sometimes, powerful, 
respectful. 
I: OK, you said that you can have a temper// 
M: //yeah// 
I: //sometimes// 

M: //yeah. 

I: When you say get a temper do you mean you get angry? 

M: Yeah. 
I: What types of things make you angry? 
M: My sister borrows stuff from me and, um
, sometimes I don't get things my own way. 
I: Sometime s you don't get things your own way . 

M: Yeah. 

I: Can you give me an example? 
M: Like if I was quite tired and just don't 
want anybody staying and something like that, 
and I can't go out late. 
I: OK. 

M: Yep. 

I: Now on this side [how I think other pe
ople see me] you've used a picture of Cat 
Deeley, a horse and the New Look logo and a phone. What are you trying to express 
on this side? 
M: I think other people see me as a trendy and 
fashionable person so they know that I 
like to go and buy clothes and things like that. 
I: So, you've got fashion on both sides// 

M: //yeah// 
I: //do you think though that there' s a di
fference between how you see yourself and how 
you think other people see you? 
M: There's a fe w differenc es I think and there's a few sa me, 'cause like so me people 
know I'm fashionable and some people don't but
 I think some people see me as quite 
a trendy person and like, I like different things. 



 
289
I: How do you think other people see you differently to how you see yourself? You 
said that there are some differences, so
 apart from the fashion, what else? 
M: Some people think I'm quite a calm person but I can actually have quite a temper. 
I: So they think you are quite calm? 
M: Yeah but I didn't actually find a picture for that yet. And like the horse actually, um 
resembles me because I'm a kind person by whole. 
I: OK, so it's really the temper// 

M: //yeah. 

I: So if you were going to use a picture to represent temper, what would you use? 
M: I would put either put a cat, I think also I'd put, um, may be like some [inaudible]. 
I: And if you had more ti me, are there any 
other pictures that you would have put onto 
your collage? 
M: I would have put more on how I see myself 
and go into more details like my feelings 
and that I can be quite an emotional person and friendly. 
I: And what would you use to represent emotional and friendly ? 
M: Maybe two characters in quite a emotional scene or something. 

I: Is there any one that y ou think of in particular when you think of emotional? 

M: Maybe Kat and Zoe [
EastEnders 
characters] or somebody like that. 
I: So, because of Kat and Zoe's relationship? 
M: Yeah. 
I: And just finally, how would you usually describe your ethnicity? 

M: Like I come from like all different bac
kgrounds, different like, different types of 
families. 
I: But if I asked you what your ethnicity is, how would you describe yourself? 

M: English. 
I: You say English. 
M: Yeah. 

I: Do you ever say British? 

M: No. 

I: Do you know// 
M: //I don't know why. 
I: So you just say English, you don't know why. 

M: Yeah. I just say English.

Sapan,13,"I: You've just done one collage yes [how I see myself]? 

S: Yeah. 

I: Can you just go through the images and words you've used and explain what you are 
trying to express with them? 
S: I've got a picture of this game [image
 of a computer game] because I really like 
playing games a lot, and I'm a Hindu that's why I put a symbol. 
I: What is this a symbol of? 

S: Hindu. 

I: This says Hindu? 

S: No it's Ohm. 
I: Ohm. 
S: Yeah. 

I: So yo u've got the word ‚Hindu' and you've got the Ohm sy mbol, and you've also 
got// 
S: //the flag// 
I: //the Indian flag. 
S: Yeah. 

I: What about Darth Vader [
Star Wars
 character]? 



 
290
S: I just like films a lot. 
I: Why did you choose Darth Vader? 

S: 'Cause that's kind of like th e films which I like, action films. 
I: Action. 
S: Yeah. 

I: And who are these two people [image of Indian actors]? 

S: They're just like Indian actors. 

I: And why have you used them there? 

S: 'Cause I like often look at, watch Hindi films. 
I: Hindi films. 
S: Yeah. 

I: Are these famous Hindi actors? 

S: Yeah, they're kind of like top. 

I: What about this cricket bat? 
S: I quite like sports and cricket. 
I: So you like sports and cricket as well? 

S: Yeah. 

I: Now, going back to these actors, who is this guy? 

S: I've forgot his name. That's 
Ashwaria [image of Indian actress]. 
I: Now on this collage there is a lot about 
being Hindu and the fact that you are from 
India. Is that very important? Are you trying to express that you feel more closely 

connected to being Indian? 
S: Yeah. 

I: Could you explain a little? 

S: I just quite like watching films actually and I'm Hindu. 
I: Is your culture important to you? 
S: Yeah. 

I: It is. 

S: Yeah. 

I: Now on this side, ‚how I think other peopl
e see me', you'v e not got any pictures. Is 
that because you don't think there is a difference or because you didn't have time? 
S: I didn't have time and I didn't ki
nd of like know how other people see me. 
I: Do you think that if you had more time to work on this and you had time to think 
about it, do you think how you see yourself would be the same as how you think other 

people see you? 
S: No, it would be, they wouldn't like kind of like see me as like playing games and into 
films. 
I: So what do you think they [other people] would see you as? 

S: I don't know. 

I: What do you think people think when they see you? How do you think they see you? 

S: Kind of like average not that much. 
I: So average. 
S: Yeah. 

I: Do you think you're average? 

S: No, not that mu ch. 

I: No. 

S: No. 
I: Do you think you're more than average? 
S: Yeah. 

I: So do you think if I took away the Indian flag and the Hindu symbol that the whole 
collage would have a different meaning? (lon
g pause) Were y ou born in this country? 
S: Yeah. 
I: But there is no British flag. So let's say, for example with the flags, why did you 
choose to use the Indian flag instead of
 the British one? Why did you choose to put 
Hindu? 



 
291
S: I would have put England as well but I didn't have time, but Indian because my 
parents co me from that cou ntry . 
I: So your parents come from India but you were born here? 
S: Yeah. 
I: So how would you usually describe your ethnicity? 

S: Indian. 

I: You'd say Indian? 

S: Yeah. 

I: So you'd say Indian even though you were born here [England]? 
S: Yeah. 
I: Yeah? 

S: Yeah, well not exactly. 

I: Why not exactly? 

S: 'Cause like I was born from here but I'm still Indian. 
I: Why are you still Indian? 
S: Because my parents come from India and I often go there. 

I: So do you identify more wi th being Indian than with British or English? 

S: Yeah. 

I: Is it important for you to let people know that you are Indian? 
S: Not that much, but still kind of like would like people to know that I'm Indian so.

Jason,13,"I: So Jason, are these two separate collages or one? 
J: They're separate. 
I: Shall we start with ‚how I see myself'? 

J: Yeah. 

I: Do you just want to go through the im
ages and explain why you've used them, what 
you are trying to express? 
J: Well I've got the gun because I get really fi
ery and angry, I got like the calm [image 
of a person in silhouette] because I like to
 be calm you know like at home, I chose 
like the mini motor because I like being fast and rushing, I don' t like animal cruelty 

that's why I got the zebra, there's some games I like [image of a wrestler] like 

wrestling and I like Triple X, a good film like stuff I like, I like alcohol. 
I: You like alcohol? 
J: Yeah. 
I: How old are you? 

J: Thirteen. 

I: But you like drinking?

I: With your friends or with your family// 
J: //with my mum. 
I: With your mum// 

J: //yeah with my mum's permission. 

I: OK, what about this picture of the boxer? 

J: Because I like boxing and I've always wanted to be a boxer. 
I: What is it about boxing that you like? 
J: To just take all your anger out and like 
respond powerfully , it's really good, and then 
afterwards you're really calm. 



 
292
I: But is it taking your anger out on a person or just being able to take your anger out 
that you like? 
J: Just get my anger out th at's better. 
I: Just get your anger out. 
J: Yeah. 

I: So we've got a mobile phone there// 

J: Yeah 'cause I like keeping (mumbles). 

I: You like? 

J: Keeping up-to-date stuff on the phone. 
I: OK and who is this [image of a wrestler]? 
J: Yeah, I like him. 

I: Who is he? 

J: I don't know his name I think its The Rock
. 'Cause he's like my wrestling hero, he's 
not a dirty fighter he's a clean fighter that's good. 
I: So even within fighting th ere are still rules// 
J: //yeah, some people like get a big chain and hammer and all that but he's a really 
clean fighter. 
I: And what about Kat Slater [
EastEnders
 character]? 
J: Oh she, like she like, 
EastEnders
 if it didn't have someone like Kat Slater it would be 
really plain, like if I like didn't have 
a lot of my friends around I think it would be 
really plain and boring. 
I: So you think Kat Slater is quite plain? 

J: No, she's really fiery and she's really good 'cause I like that. 

I: Oh, so she's kind of similar to how
 you feel. She's quite a fiery person// 
J: //yeah, and like she's not afraid to do anything. 
I: So y ou like her assertivene ss// 
J: //yeah// 

I: //and that she's a bit// 

J: //yeah, she's not really quiet she's not afra
id to say anything she just comes out with 
it. 
I: And finally on this side you've used a flag of England. 
J: Oh because th at's my home country. 

I: Your home country. If you were going to
 use some words to 
describe the feelings 
that you are trying to express in all th
ese pictures, what words would you use? 
J: Like really, that's how I feel I am. 

I: So what types of words would you use? 
J: Like ambitious and I like get on with things and that. 
I: You're ambitious, y ou like to get on with things. You can be quite calm? 

J: Yeah calm when I really want to be. 

I: And quite angry ? 

J: Yeah. 
I: What makes you angry? 
J: Teacher s. 

I: Just teachers? 

J: And people like, time is just sitting there 
going really slow and all that and it gets 
really frustrating and I find that makes me really angry. 
I: What about [image of a zebra]// 
J: //oh, animal cruelty I hate that. 
I: What is it about cruelty to animals that// 

J: //they kill them to test them and like 
make-up and that, and I think that's really 
wrong. 
I: Why is it wrong? 
J: Because it's not fair like that they're dyi
ng and that just so we can get a lipstick like 
what won't last very long. 



 
293
I: So do you think there can ever be a time where you can test on animals and it would 
be alright? 
J: Um, no I don't think there can. 
I: Not even for medicine? 
J: For medicine that's different, for make-up I// 

I: //so for cosmetics// 

J: //no, medical yeah I understand that, but make-up no. 

I: OK let's move onto how you think other people see you. Do you want to go through 
the pictures again and// 
J: //that big like devil because everyone say
s like I'm fiery or I can get really angry 
loads and the little devil because the teacher
s say to me, Miss Staines will say she 
always calls me a little devil. 
I: You've also got a picture [image from animated film 
Madagascar
] of// 
J: //oh yeah, because I'm a family person. 
I: So what's that from? 
J: 
Madagascar
, yeah I like that film. 
I: And you've also got pictures of sport, like the cars and the football. 

J: Yeah 'cause I like my cars 'cause I love my cars and Man Utd and Saints and 
England. 
I: And what about the picture of this girl [how I think other people see me]? 
J: Richard my best mate he says I'm obsessed by girls. 

I: You're obsessed? 

J: Yeah he says. 

I: And are you? 

J: Um, I don't know, I'm not sure. 
I: So we've got fiery and angry and the devil 
which is here [how I see myself] as well, 
but do you think that there is a differen
ce between how you think other people see 
you// 
J: //yeah. 

I: What's the difference? 
J: Because Samuel thinks I'm like that ther
e [angry and fiery], so he thinks I've never 
got a quiet side to me, but I have, I've got like a really quiet side to me and I've got a 

really angry side. 
I: So y ou think other pe
ople only see the angry side? 
J: Yeah. 

I: So why do you think other 
people don't see the quiet side? 
J: Because I get wound up really eas
y, you know I'm always annoyed. 
I: You're always annoyed// 

J: //yeah// 

I: //but you have got a quiet side? 

J: Yeah, yeah. 
I: Do you usually, when you're at home// 
J: //yeah, I'm really quiet and I just go and play PlayStation and listen to music. 

I: What type of music? 

J: R&B. 

I: R&B. 

J: Yeah and Eminem. 
I: What is it about Eminem that you identify with? 
J: Because he talks about his life and people and all that. 

I: Why is that a good thing? 

J: Because it makes me think what I do during the day. 

I: It makes you think// 
J: //what I done in the day, why I have done things and all that. 
I: But do you think there is anything bad about Eminem? 



 
294
J: He is really because he sort of carri
es stuff around with him like he takes drugs and 
that's bad. 
I: So you don't agree with that// 
J: //no I don't agree with taking drugs and smoking, but I like his music. 
I: But you like his mu sic because he's talking about his life// 

J: //yeah he's talking about life and all that// 

I: And that mak es y ou think about your own life// 

J: //yeah all the things that I've done wrong and don't want to do again. 

I: If you had more time are there any extra pictures that you would have put on? 
J: Yeah I would have like to have put some
 more calm pictures on because I do like to 
be calm. 
I: You would have like to have put more calm pictures on. 

J: Yeah, because I do like being calm. I am calm at home a lot but when I'm at school I 
get really angry, but at home I'm really calm and relaxed. 
I: What do you think it is about outside that makes you angry? Is it just people? 
J: Yeah it's when people get in the way and that and like in school, and I just barge past, 
I hate waiting around. 
I: It's the waiting around, you can't stand it? 

J: Yeah waiting around, like just get on with things. 
I: And just finally, how would you usually describe your ethnicity? 
J: I'm not religious but I do believe in my country. 

I: So would you say that you were British or English? 

J: I'm English. 

I: You would say you were English? 

J: Yeah. 
I: Why would you choose English over British? 
J: Because British that's a really big place, like I'm in England and I know it's the 
football team as well, 'cause British that's Scottish as well. 
I: So English is like// 

J: //yeah my home// 
I: //your home and more specific// 
J: //yeah. 

I: What does being English mean to you? 

J: Like England's got their own football team
 and all that, and England is just like a 
separate name, your standard. 
I: What do you mean your standard? 
J: Because British is just like a totally diff
erent flag innit', England and British totally 
different flag. I find English means a lot more. 
I: English means a lot more. 

J: Yeah. 

I: Why does it mean a lot more? 
J: 'Cause we use it a lot mo re, it's mo re
 common. British, that sounds wrong.

ke doing, whereas that one [how I think other 
people see me] i s how I think people see me. 
I: So let's start with ‚how I see my self'. Do
 y ou just want to go through the images an d 
explain why you've used each image, what you are what you are trying to express 

with them? 
M: I've used those two [images of a guitar 
and Gorillaz] because I like music and I look 
up to them. 
I: What is it about the Gorillaz that you look up to? 



 
295
M: I think they're a good band and also the singer, um// 
I: //Damon Albarn. 

M: Yes him, has lots of political views that I agree with. 
I: Such as? 
M: Stuff like the Live 8 thing he said they 
should have had more mu
lticultural bands and 
I agreed with that. 
I: You agree with// 

M: //his views about Live 8 and how that was run and everything. 

I: What about his other political views? 
M: I don't know but I assume he's good like 
that across mo st stuff that I don't agree 
with. 
I: OK, I know you relate to Damon Albarn and 
his politics, but what is it about that th e 
music that you specifically like? 
M: I think it's different but still interesting a
nd not sort of annoying it's a, it's cool but 
it's not annoying and you can listen to it anytime without it being annoying. 
I: So it's kind of like the fact that it's not mainstream, run of the mill// 

M: //yeah it's relaxed and sort of guitar driven. 

I: You've got a little picture of 
The Simpsons
 [cartoon] there. 
M: Yeah, that's just because I like 
The Simpsons
 really, it's funny. 
I: OK. 
M: I've got two games because I like playing PlayStation ‚cause its fun. I've got a 
picture of George Bush with a red line ac
ross his face because I disagree with the way 
that he does things. 
I: Such as? 

M: Such as the war in Iraq for example. 
I: Why do you disagree with that? 
M: Because I don't think its fair or
 the right way to go about things. 
I: What// 

M: //just violence you know what I mean. 

I: So you don't agree with war or violence? 
M: No, and I don't think that w
as the right time to use it either. 
I: When would have been the right time to use it? 

M: I don't know, I think they were ill-informed and rushed into it. 

I: OK, and who are these guys [image of a black model and Michael Jackson]? 

M: Well that one [image of a black model] it'
s because I think he looks pretty stylish and 
chilled out, and I put in Michael Jackson b
ecause he's an amazing dancer, he's just 
cool. 
I: You think Michael Jackson is cool? 

M: Not nowadays, but I think he was cool when
 he did all his amazi
ng dancing and that's 
why he's an icon, but not anymore. 
I: So are you using him on the basis that he is cool? 
M: Yeah. 
I: So if you were going to use a few words to sum up what you are trying to express 
with the images, like we've got cool, what other words would you add to that? 
M: Relaxed and not popular in terms of 
mainstream what everybody likes, and not 
unhappy because I'm always sort of grateful. I don't like really miserable stuff. 
I: So are you quite a content person? 
M: Yeah, yeah I'm happy with my life kind of thing. 
I: So let' s move on to how 
you think other people see you. 
M: Well those two [image of a black man with scarf over mouth and a black and white 
model] it's about, I think people might see 
me as threatening when I'm walking down 
the street with my friends and things 'cau
se we shout a lot and talk loudly and I sort 
of like maybe look threatening to other people. 
I: And you've also got the word ‚shifty' there. 

M: Yeah. 



 
296
I: Is that because you think people might think you are a bit of a shifty character? 
M: Yeah, when we're sort of walking down a
nd sort of shouting and being loud and what 
we're doing and everything. 
I: Because the people that represent thre aten
ing are the black guy with the Union Jack 
around his mouth and, do you know who this
 person is [black and white image]? 
M: No, but I just thought he was sort of// 

I: //why does he look threatening? 

M: Because he's in black and white and he's sort of standing th ere, he looks sort of like 
he's gonna, I don't know he just looks 
like, like threatening and out there. 
I: And what about this guy [image of a black man], why is he threatening? 
M: ' Cause he' s got his arms cr ossed and he's all sort of, um threatening looking. 

I: OK, let's move onto this man with flowers round his neck. What does he mean? 

M: He's like that because I'm meant to be la
ughing a lot of the time and he's sort of 
wearing bright clothes which I don't normally wear bright clothes I sort of act in a 
sort of happy, laughing, jolly sort 
of way which is how he' s dressed. 
I: And what about these pictures of the skater and the t-shirt [‚if you see anyo ne else 
wearing this t-shirt I must be dead']? 
M: Well I like skating and I like skating in public places although not much anymore, but 
I still do it now and again and I thought th at was a cool t-shirt. 
I: So do you think there's a difference between how you see yourself and how you think 
other people see you? 
M: Yeah that's much more, how I think ot
her people see me is much more a sort of 
outward appearance, whereas that [how I see myself] is what I like to do and how I 

like to be. 
I: So you said other people might see you as threatening, do you think you are 
threatening? 
M: I don't personally think I am threatening but I must seem very loud and shouting and 
things. 
I: Right, so do you think when other people look at yo u they see yo u as somebody who 
is interested in politics and who is quite
 relaxed and removed from the mainstream, 
not part of the mainstream and who thinks a bit differently? 
M: Yeah, yeah but only if they know me and everything. 

I: But what if they don't? 

M: If they don't know me they just think I'm another person that's just being sort of 
annoying and threatening and everything. 
I: Does that annoy you, that fact that people think about you that way? 
M: Sometimes but not really I just see it as, 
well I don't really know them or anything so 
it's no big deal I suppose. 
I: And just finally, how would you usually describe your ethnicity? 

M: I'd say I was British or English. 

I: Which one of them do you usually use? 
M: I'd use British because some of my family is from Wales. 
I: So y ou'd use British because// 

M: //it includes everyone in my family.

Joe,14,"I: So let's start with ‚how I see myself'. Do
 you want to go through the images you' ve 
used and explain what you are trying to express with each of them? 
J: There's various music things like the MP3 
player and the guitar and stuff because I'm 
in a band and I like writing music a lot, I'
m doing new songs all the time. There's a 
picture of Jimmy Carr because I think I'm quite funny. A mobile phone is there 
because I'm in contact with my friends quite
 a lot, like quite outgoing. There's a 
picture of an ey e because I'm a visual learne
r. I don't like Tony Blair because he's 



 
297
bad because he went to war and all that. 
 There is a comic book because I like comics 
I like reading a lot. There's a watch because I'm always on time. 
I: Right, Tony Blair you said he's a bad man. 
J: Yeah. 
I: Why is he a bad man? 

J: Because he took us to war and I don't think that was the right decision. 

I: So you think it wasn't the right decision. By making that statement do you see 
yourself as quite a political person? 
J: Yeah. 
I: What other political issues do you feel quite strongly about? 
J: Um, I'm not really sure really. 

I: What is it about Tony Blair that really anno
ys you? Is it just the war thing or is there 
any thing else? 
J: It's mainly the way he goes about things, the way he does things. 
I: And how does he// 
J: //I don't think he puts much thought into what he's doing. 

I: He doesn't put much thought// 

J: //no, he just goes ahead with what he 
thinks should happen and doesn't think abou t it 
long-term. 
I: So he doesn't think about the long-term and he doesn't really listen to the public? 
J: Yeah. 

I: OK, the musi c, I've noticed that you'v
e got Franz Ferdinand and Chris Martin from 
Coldplay. Now I'm assuming that you really like these bands// 
J: //yeah// 

I: //but what is it about these bands that you identify with? 
J: It's their music mainly, it's about how they like play music. 
I: But what is it specifically, what is it th
at their music expresses that you can identify 
with? Is it just the fact that they play their own instruments or is it more than that? 
J: Yeah, y eah as I said they play their own inst
ruments, they play what they want to play 
like their emotions or what they were thinki
ng about at the time when they make the 
song. 
I: So that's impo rtant, that people are expressing their emotions and are what we call 
real musicians? 
J: Yeah. 

I: Moving onto the ey e, you said that y ou learn visually . 

J: Yeah. 
I: What do you mean by that? 
J: I like looking at diagrams and like statistics 
and stuff like that rather than just reading 
a book and, it's like the same thing with 
the comi cs I like pictures with the words. 
I: Right OK. And Jimmy Carr, yo u said th at he's quite funny and that you see yourself 
as quite funny. Why do you see 
yourself as quite a funny person? 
J: Because I think I'm quite laid back
 and quite open about things as well. 
I: Let' s move onto ‚how I 
think other people see me'. 
J: Well there's the ‚fraud' [word], for instance 
lots of older people think that they , you 
know, like kids are like bad people, people 
who steal, people who do things like that. 
I: Right. 

J: And they think that we're rebels, so we'r
e all rebels and we're all out to cause trouble 
and stuff. 
I: And that's how you think other people see you? 

J: Yeah, yeah because people have said it to me before. 

I: And what about the ‚suffering' [word]? 

J: Well that's just wound up with the whole thing it's like they [o ther people] see, 
because lots of people live in council places and stuff like that and people th ink 
they're suffering and they're feeling bad about themselves. 
I: Do you live in a council estate? 



 
298
J: Yeah my mum, with my mum I do. 
I: And what about the red? 

J: That's just to represent anger. 
I: So do you think that other people are justified to see you that way, or do you think 
that is a comp letely incorrect image of how you see yourself? 
J: I think that's an absolute incorrect 
image 'cause I'm not like that, I'm not a bad 
person. 
I: So you think other people, because of
 y our upbringing, see y ou as a bad person 
because of living on a council estate? 
J: Yeah. 
I: So there's a huge difference between how you see yourself and how you think other 
people see you? 
J: Yeah. 

I: If you had more time are there any other 
pictures that you would have added to your 
collage? 
J: On this side [how I think other people see me] I would probably put like black 
rappers because most people think young 
people are into rap 'cause we're all 
gangsters and that. 
I: So do you think that rappers re
present violence and everything bad? 
J: No, some are, but that's 'cause that's
 how they're shown sometimes, but not all 
rappers are bad you know. 
I: Can you give me an examp le 
of a rapper who is bad though? 
J: There was that guy from So Solid Crew he 
got done for having guns. 
 It's not cool for 
kids to see that sort of thing, like their idols being put in prison, but they' re not all 

like that y ou know. 
I: And just finally , if some one asked you your ethnicity , what would you usually 
describe yourself as? 
J: British probably. 

I: Would you say British or English? 

J: I'd say British. 
I: Why would you say British? 
J: Because I've got a Welsh bac
kground and Scottish background as well. 
I: So British is more inclusive?

I: So do you want to go through the pictures and explain why you've used them? 

F: First of all I'm talking about Somalia. I'm from Africa, my parents born there. 

I: Were y ou born there? 

F: No I'm born in Sweden. 

I: In Sweden. 
F: Yeah, and my parents and my cousins 
are from Somal ian and I'm from Somalian.

F: Yeah. 

I: And how long have you been here [England]? 

F: I've been here one year and seven months. That thingy shows real life, and real life 
shows about my family, the lines that I come from, my cousins and lots of things. 
I: OK. 

F: This is a movie; this is like a new comedy that comes on.

I: 
That's So Raven
. 
F: Yeah and I like that one because I watch twi
ce movie. And this girl and boy it's like 
a family show, a friendship and that lot things. 
I: OK. 
F: And them two girls are like friends and I got in the middle the family. 

I: You've got the family and why is 
this here [images if female boxers]? 
F: Because they're fighting about the family. 

I: Is it fighting in the family or fighting over the family? 

F: Fighting over the family . 
I: Who is fighting over the family then? 
F: Both of them. 

I: Why are they fighting? 

F: I'm just making an example. 

I: Yes. 
F: She's like fighting for the baby, she's fighting for the little girl and they're like 
family, and she wants the boy and she wants 
the girl. They're fighting having fun, 
that sort of thing. 
I: OK.

I: Lindsey Lohan?

I: Why do you like her? 

F: I like her dress and her hair. 
I: You like her hair? 
F: Yeah. 

I: So you think she's pretty? 

F: Yeah. 

I: And you'v e also got pictures of women with headscarv es on, is that because that links 
with the religion? 
F: Yeah. 

I: So what about this picture here [image of Chinese girls]? 

F: It's a presentation of China like the ne
w phones like coming out, they're like making 
new phones like a camera phone. 
I: So looking at this, the country that y our parents co me fro m is very important to you. 
Is it important for you to say that I'm Somalian? 
F: Yeah. 

I: And also your religion is featured quite a lot. Is that very important to you? 

F: Yeah, it's very important for me. 

I: Why is it so important? 
F: I like to like say how it's like, how important like my family is being like from 
Somalia and Muslim, that's 
more important to me, how 
my family thinks about 
what's important. 
I: And just finally, how would you usually describe your ethnicity? 

F: Well if they like asked me where I come from I would say Somalian but I'm not born 
there, I'm born in Sweden. 
I: So what do you see yourself as? Do you see yourself as Somalian or Swedish? 
F: Somalian. 

I: But what about now you live in Britain? Do you feel British? 

F: Yeah a bit. 

I: So what one would you choose to describe yourself? 
F: Somalian. 
I: Why would you go for Somalian? 

F: Because I like Somalian house I live ther

I: //who is that? 
S: That's Freddie Ljungberg who plays for Arsenal and I picked him because well, I 
didn't really know myself when I found out who my real dad was so I thought well 
Freddie Ljungberg he's foreign and he plays 
for an English team and he's like, he's 
been put down loads and loads of times by the press and all that so I thought like well 

we're kind of both outcasts so about the same 'cause we like (pause). 
I: Go on. 

S: Um, well I d idn't know my self at the ti
me because I didn't know who my real dad 
was and all that because my mum said like your dad ain' t your dad and stuff like that 
and I thought OK what's going on, then I read in the newspaper that Freddie 
Ljungberg was being put down by the press and he, and he was saying a lot that he 

was sacked and hired, sacked and hired fro
m the b oss and it's the sa me thing, that 
loads of big surprises a big thing and what you can't expect and what you should 

expect. 
I: Right OK. 
S: And I got the car because um, because I really like driving because I go to Go-Karts a 
lot and it's a big hobby of mine. 
I: So if you were going to use some words to express what the pictures ar e trying to say, 
what words would you use? 
S: For? 
I: How you see yourself. 

S: What, just for each picture? 

I: Just in general. Like do y ou think y ou're quite happy or sad or confused or// 

S: //um, I'm kind of confused but happy about it. 

I: Confused but happy about it// 
S: //yeah 'cause I know that I'
ll find out and I know that I won't be confused for much 
longer. Like just to say I'll find out. 
I: About? 

S: About what I'm confused about. 

I: And what is it that y ou're confused about? 
S: Um my dad and like what he's like a
nd he's got kids and anything like that. 
I: Right. So let's move onto how you thi
nk other people see you. Now on this side 
you've just got a picture of a zip over a mouth and then ‚what on god's green earth' in 

words. What are you trying to express? 
S: With the zip well I'm very talkative and pe
ople usually like to shut me up so I put the 
zip over the mouth and what on god's green earth is well um, I've got a reputation for 
being really random and people usually say 
what's he doing and things like that so 
it's usually just like a major question of what I am. 
I: Do you think there's a difference between how you see yourself and how you think 
other people see you? 
S: Um no. 
I: Do you thin k, like mayb e do you think there are things here [how I see myself] that 
other people don' t see, or do you think that there are maybe things that other people 

might see that are not how you see yourself? Do you understand? 
S: Yeah, yeah, because I am like very secretiv
e I don't talk about personal things I just 
talk about what other people think and what's just happened and the new stuff so I 

don't usually like tend to waste time talkin
g about me 'cause I don't really think it's 
relevant at any of the time. I don't want to talk so I just think. 
I: So, what I think you're saying is that other people don't really know the emotional 
side of you? 
S: No not really because, well like I don't like to cry in public or anything like that so 
that's kind of an emotional secret, um I don't like being hurt. It doesn't matter if 
somebody calls me a name because I'll eith
er take it, you know call them a name 
back and, well, I don' t want them to know 
what hurts me 'cause I don't want them to 



 
305
see me cry or hurt so I don't want them to 
like see me ' cause I just want to remain 
random so. 
I: So it's easier because it's like a defence// 
S: //yeah// 
I: //because you're random and they don't know y
our weak points, they can't get to you, 
they can't hurt you. 
S: Yeah. 

I: And just finally, how would you usually describe your ethnicity? 

S: Well um, I've heard that my dad is Irish
 so I'll be in between English and Irish. 
I: But if somebody asked you now, how would you usually describe your ethnicity, 
what would you say? 
S: I'd say I'm English. 

I: You'd say you're English, but would that 
change if your dad was Irish? What would 
you say then? 
S: Well I'd say, well I haven't known him a
nd he didn't know that he was my dad so 
that's a ma ssive revelation for both of us, a
nd well he just wants to get on with his life 
and I want to get on with my life but we want
 to know each other at the same time so 
I don't think we are going to inter-lock that well, I just think that we are going to be 

friends. 
I: OK//

Scott,14,"I: Are these two separate collages? 
S: Yeah. 
I: Let's start with ‚how I see myself'. Do you want to go through the images and 
explain what you are trying to express with them? 
S: Well this [drawing of a flag] is national 
identity, the Union Jack because I'm E nglish, 
and I used two people playing guitars because I like guitars. 
I: OK so you like guitars. What sort of music do you like? 
S: Um, well, um rock, indie. 
I: What is about rock and indie that you like? Because here you've got Franz 
Ferdinand, what is it about their music that you like? 
S: I like the blend of hard and soft sounds
 with the bass and then you get guitars in 
overdrive and then you get drums which are like a boom and then you cymbals as 
well which are like shhh. 
I: But don't you get the same sounds in pop mu sic? 

S: Not really 'cause you get like synth
esizers and things in music, pop music. 
I: Let's move onto the rabbit. What 
are you try ing to express with that? 
S: That's how I think I act towards other people. 

I: In what way? 
S: Sort of like nice. 
I: And what about that [image of
 a smiling mouth], is that happy? 
S: Yeah. 

I: And what is that? 

S: That's running 'cause I like athletics. 
I: OK, let' s move onto ‚how I think other 
people see me'. Now this is significantly 
different to the other side, so let's start with [image of a woman with big hair]// 
S: //bad hair. I had my hair cut at the week
end and that's what I had, massive bad hair.

I: So what about B.A. Baracus, what is he there for? 
S: Mr T, because um, you get people saying to me quite a lot you know because I'm big 
and stuff, Mr T. 
I: And you've got 50 Cent's [
how I think other people see me]. 
S: Yeah 'cause people say, they say like you're naughty, robbery. 

I: So he represents that you're a bit of yob and you're a bit of a thug// 

S: //only people who don't know me. 

I: Do you think 50 Cent's is a thug and a hoodlum? 

S: No he's playing at angry. 
I: But do you think he's a positive or negative role model? 
S: A negative role model but I don't know 
him that much I don't know what he's done 
apart from in his videos, but he's playing though, playing at ultra-macho. 
I: And Mr Blair, why have you used him? 

S: Becaus e he wears suits and th
at represents to me nerdiness. 
I: So you see yourself as a nerd? 
S: Mmm. 

I: So do you think that there is a differe
nce between how you see yourself and how yo u 
think other people see you? 
S: Yeah. 
I: What would you say is the biggest difference or biggest differences? 
S: Um. 

I: Like here [how I see myself] you've got 
happy and nice and that
 doesn't feature on 
how you think other people see you. Do you think that' s because other people just 

don't see that side of you? 
S: No, not until they talk to me and get to know me// 
I: //right// 
S: //as myself rather than just as what they think I am. 

I: So do you think that if people were ju
st to look at you their assumptions would be 
completely incorrect about you? 
S: Yeah. 
I: And just finally, how would you usually describe your ethnicity? 
S: English. 

I: Do you always say English? 

S: Yeah. 

I: Why do you say English, because you have got the British flag there? 

S: I don't know it's just something I do by instinct. 
I: It's just something you do by instinct. 
S: I come from England. 

I: So it's because you come from England it's just instinctual to say I'm English?

A: Yeah. 

I: Do you want to start with ‚how I see my
self' and go through the pictures and explain 
what they are and what you are representing with them? 
A: Well this is how I see myself. I've got a England country because that's where I'm 
from and I've got a football player because I 
like to play football and sporty, I like 
boxing and I'm sporty type of person, I like 
sports so I watch spor
ts people. Here, I

got political person here [image of George 
Bush] and I think I'm very loud [image of

r people see you. What do these pictures 
mean? 
A: Well I've used clothes to indicate that 
people see me that I like wearing clothes and 
that, and people like me like wearing clothes like. 
I: And what about this monkey and the game? 

A: I've got the monkey because people someti
me s think I'm a bit ch
eeky at times just 
like a monkey and I like, people think I like games a lot so I put games on there. 
I: Now on this side, on ‚how I think other 
people see me', you've put down that people 
think that you're cheeky and that you like games and you like clothes. 
A: Yeah. 

I: But on how you see yourself you've put the politician and th e guns that you say 
represent the serious side of you. Do you think that other people see that side of you? 
A: No, there are two sides of me, like sometimes I'm all serious and sometimes I'm 
more funny and someti mes I see myself as all serious, but mostly I'm more like 

cheeky and a funny character th
at's why I put that there. 
I: Do y ou think that there is a difference between how y ou see y ourself and how you 
think other people see you? 
A: Yeah because like normally I'm serious to myself and not to other people, to other 
people I'm funny and to myself I'm like more serious. 
I: Why do you th ink th at is? 

A: Because I like to joke with other people and with myself I' m nor mal like.

they understand that side of you?

pictures there [how I think other people see me].

A: //yeah I would have put like, I would put
 more like peaceful stuff over here, maybe 
other people see me more as a peaceful kind of person. 
I: What would you use to represent peaceful? 
A: I'd be like sea and, sea and waves and that with a beach and that, a river. 
I: And just finally, how would you usually describe your ethnicity?

I: Do y ou want to go through each of th
e images that you've used and explain why 
you've used them and what you are trying to express? 
Z: With the award picture what I tried to express was that how I'm always like winning 
awards and stuff. With the apple I trie
d to express how I was eating healthily and 
keeping to good diet and stuff. With th
e watch I wa s try ing to express how organised 
I was, everyday. With the mirror I was 
trying to express how obsessive sometimes I 
can be. 
I: Obsessive about? 

Z: Like my hair and stuff. 

I: So y our looks or is it every thing? 
Z: Just my looks. 
I: OK. 

Z: With the clothes I was trying to expr
ess like how creative I can be and stuff. 
I: What about the guy who is reading 
Touch
 [image of a man reading a magazine]? 
Z: Yeah I was trying to express how good I can read and that I like, enjoy reading 
everyday. 
I: OK. 
Z: With the spider like how, how like tall I feel and stuff. 

I: How? 

Z: Tall like I feel. 

I: How does the spider represent// 
Z: //spiders like long legs, that's ho
w I feel with long arms and legs. 
I: Right. 

Z: And with the coffee bit how hyper sometimes I can get, and this woman [image of a 
black woman] trying to express how long my hair can be. 
I: So let's move onto how you think other people see you. You've used a picture of a 
girl in a long coat and a pretty model, what do they represent? 
Z: How tall she is and how tall I feel, the girl wearing the coat. 
I: And who is that guy [image of a black man]? 

Z: He's a famous rapster.

I: So do you think other 
people see you as beautiful? 
Z: Um sometimes. 

I: Do you see yourself as beautiful? 

Z: Yeah. 
I: You do. 
Z: Yeah. 

I: Do you think there is a difference between how you think other people see you and 
how you see yourself? Because her e on this side [how I see myself ] you've got 

creativity and you like reading and about the awards and the achievements, but that's 
not on that side [how I thi
nk other people see me]. Do you think other people see that 
side of you? 
Z: Yeah sometimes they do.

I: When would they? 
Z: When I've been like, when I receive le
tters at home and stuff saying that I've 
achieved good in some lessons, like when I'm 
in class and stuff and I've been doing 
good work and the teacher like says it 
across the class then that's nice. 
I: Do y ou think there are any differences between how you see yourself and how you 
think other people see you? 
Z: Um not really, not that much difference. 

I: If there's not that much what is the 
difference? What do you think the biggest 
difference is? 
Z: The biggest difference is about the serious, how serious people see me. 
I: So you think people see you as a lot// 

Z: //yeah// 

I: //more serious than you are. Why do you think that is? 

Z: Because of how I act like everyd ay I come to school and stuff, th ey see probably the 
serious side of me and they just think,
 they just judge me like the way I look. 
I: If there was more time, are there any othe
r pictures that you would have put on your 
collage? 
Z: Yeah on how other people see me. 

I: What would you put? 
Z: Think I'd put more serious faces there. 
I: More serious faces? 

Z: Yeah 'cause that's the impression that people see of me.

E: Yeah. 
I: Do you think then that how you see yoursel
f is the same, or did you not do that 
because you didn't know how to or that there wasn't enough time?

her pictures you could add, what types of 
pictures would you have added?

'cause I find myself funny, that's about it. 
I: I've also noticed that you've used
 a lot of images of black people. 
E: Yeah. 

I: Now, for example, if I changed these pictures so they weren't images of black people 
and I maybe used white people or Asian looking people or Chinese// 
E: //yeah// 

I: // would it still have the same meaning? 

E: Yeah, I don't think the colour matters so much. 

I: You don't think so. 

E: No, but for him [Kanye West], like some of the things he says, the way he sings about 
like life I don't think that could be a white man. 
I: I don't know what Kanye West sings about. 

E: I can't explain it like. 

I: What do you mean? 

E: Right he sings for black people sometimes 
but the rest of them if you changed them I 
think it would work, yeah it would work. 
I: It would work except for Kanye West? 

E: Yeah. 

I: And just finally, how you would usually describe your ethnicity? What do you 
usually say? 
E: Well if you asked me I would say my mum's from St. Lucia and my dad's Jamaican, 
but if you ask me about me I say I'm Caribbean. 
I: You would say you were Caribbean? 

E: Yeah. 

I: Were you born in this country?

Winnie the Pooh], that's for pretty [image of a toy duck], that's for angel baby 
[word ], and that's another one for cute [image
 of a kitten], that's for angel and that's 
for cuddly [image of a care bear]. 
I: OK you've got Amir Khan. Why have you used him? 

M: For a boxer, because I'm into
 fighting a little bit as well. 
I: And yo u've got// 
M: //this is a spaceship [image of 
Dhoom
 poster], and that's b
ecause I like motorbikes so 
that's like all my mates like motorbikes as well 
that's a motorbike, and that [image of 
a man and woman] is for a person that I like. 
I: You've not done an
ything on the other side [how I 
think other people see me], so do 
you think how you see yourself is the same as how you think other people see you? 
M: A little bit. 
I: Where is the difference? 

M: It's like maybe they see a little bit more difference. 

I: In what way? 

M: About, I see myself as pretty and like maybe they don't. 
I: So you see yourself as pretty and you think other people maybe don't. 
M: Yeah. 

I: I've also noticed on your collage that you've used a lot of Asian people. 

M: Yeah. 

I: Why is that? (pause) Let's say, for exampl
e, if I changed these pictures and put white 
or black people, would it still have the same meaning for yo u? 
M: Yeah. 
I: It would? 

M: Yeah. 

I: But why did you choo se Asian people instead of// 

M: //because peop le had cut out everything when I was looking and that. 
I: So it's got nothing more to do with you identifying more with Asian// 
M: //no nothing to do with that. I would have 
used white people, I just couldn't find the 
meaning behind them. 
I: So you couldn't find the meaning behi
nd the images of white people but you could 
find the meaning of// 
M: //like if I did find them they didn't have
 nothing to do with friendship or something 
like that. 
I: But what I mean is, you couldn't find the meaning with white images but you could 
see the meanings in the images of the Asian people? 
M: Yes. 

I: So the meaning, what you wanted to e
xpress, were they clearer in the pictures of// 
M: //yes// 
I: //the Asian people that you looked at? 

M: They was. 



 
315
I: And y ou couldn't find them sa me mean ings in the images of// 
M: //if I could I did, but then other people took those as well, but other people took those 
images that I wanted and stuff like that. 
I: OK. So you feel no type of connection with pictures of the Asian people? 
M: No. 

I: Why do you think the other people picked the images of the white people? 

M: 'Cause then they'd have something linked to like, to link it with them. 

I: Like? 

M: Like they ma ybe want something to do w
ith kind or meaning behind it so they took it. 
I: But why would they take the pictures of the white people? Like you've got 
friendship there, why do you think that they wouldn't be able to use that for 

friendship? 
M: They wouldn't. It's just that if whoever finds it you take it quick innit. 

I: Er// 
M: //like my other mat e she did take it and sh
e got some like that as well but she mostly 
got white as well and we shared some and she goes to me just take what you get. 
I: And how would you usually describe your ethnicity? 

M: Asian. 

I: Do you say Asian? 
M: Pakistani. 
I: Pakistani. Do you ever describe yourself as English or British? 

M: I would say I'm Asian British. 

I: But do you say Asian British or Pakistani? 

M: Because I'm Pakistani as well, but if they [other people] proper wanting details then 
I'm Pakistani and British. 
I: But what do you usually say? 
M: Pakistani. 

I: So you usually say Pakistani? 

M: Yeah. 

I: So you don't usually say British? 
M: No 'cause I'm Pakistani. 
I: Why do you say Pakistani rather than British or English? 

M: Because my family is Pakistani and my bac
kground is here I say Pakistani, and if they 
say where were you born then I say British I'm London, I was born in London. 
I: So do you iden tify mo re, do you see yourself mo re as Pakistani than// 

M: //British no. I say as much as I'm British, I'm British 'cause I was born here and I' m 
Pakistani 'cause my mum and dad are Pakistani. 
I: But what I mean is, why do you call yourself Pakistani when people ask you? 

M: Because that's what I am. 

I: You're Pakistani? 

M: Yeah. 
I: OK that's brilliant.

N: //no not really. 

I: So you think this could be one collage?

I: No differences? 
N: No I don't think so.

Malik,13,"I: So Malik is this one collage or two collages? 
M: Two collages. 

I: Let's start with ‚how I see
 myself'. Do you want to explain what you are trying to 
represent wit h each picture? 
M: The monkey, I see myself as a cheeky person and I act a bit silly and I use light guns 
and explosions and every thing [image of a 
man firing a gun], and the football, I like 
football I like playing it, the football and the ball are together, and I see myself as a 
good football player. The car well I would dream of having a very big car so that's 

how I see myself. 
I: Now under how you th ink other people see you you've just used a lion// 

M: //yeah// 
I: //what does that mean? 



 
317
M: 'Cause people see me as a really like happ
y and kind person and everybody says that 
to me as w ell and like in this case the lion looks happy so it represent me, how other 

people see myself, how other people see me. 
I: So you think people see you// 
M: //yeah, yeah// 

I: //as a happy and kind person// 

M: //yeah. 

I: Do y ou think there are any differences between how you see yourself and how you 
think other people see you? 
M: Not exactly, well there are a bit. 
I: Like? 

M: I wear like kind of rap style clothes but I don't see myself as a gangster, but then 
other people do because of the clothes I wear and I don't really want them to think 

that because it's a difference there. 
I: So you think that when people see yo
u wearing them clothes they make the 
assumption that you're a gangster? 
M: Mmm but I don't see myself as a gangster, but other people do because of the clothes 
I wear. 
I: OK, if you had more time are there any other pictures that you would have added 
onto this? 
M: Well I would have added like other happy 
pictures because, as I told you, people see 
me as a happy person and, yeah I would ha
ve added things like football and cars and 
stuff because I'm kind of chatty I chat a 
lot I'm very talkative, and y eah all those 
things. 
I: Do you think that there is anything about how you see yourself that other people 
don't see? 
M: No. 

I: And just finally how would y
ou usually describe y our ethnicity ? 
M: Asian British. 

I: Do you always say Asian British? 
M: Most of the time. 
I: What would you say if you didn't say that? 

M: Pakistani. 

I: Pakistani. What one do y ou use more often? 

M: Asian British because I'm Asian and I was born in Britain. 

I: When do you say Pakistani then? 
M: I don't usually say it because I'm half ha
lf, I'm Gujaraati and half Pakistani. I'm 
Asian and I'm British born so I regard mysel

J: I' ve used the car because I can um (long pause). 
I: What are you trying to say? (pause) OK le
t's move on, let's go onto Peggy Mitchell

you've got a picture of a little girl. What are you trying to say with them?

J: Sometime s, it depends who I'm around.

J: Yeah. 

I: Do you think then there's a differe
nce between how you see yourself and how you 
think other people see you?

J: When I see myself, I' m really rude and when other people see me they see I'm kind 
and shy. 
I: You see yourself as rude? 

J: Yeah. 
I: Why do you see yourself as rude? 
J Because my friends and me are like rude yeah and, it's just a bit, it just carries around 
with me.

J: I'm half English and half Irish. 
I: So do you alway s say half? 
J: Yeah. 

I: Do you ever say I'm English and that's it? 

J: No. 

I: Why do you always say I'm half Irish and half English?

sounds like you' re boring because you sa
y you're English you're boring.

I: Let' s start with ‚how I see myself' . Do yo
u want to just go through the pictures and 
explain why you've used them and what you're 
try ing to express? So let's start with 
this flag. 
B: I draw it because, er, I Pakistani and my parents and stuff like that. 

I: And you've got a cricket player here// 

B: //because I li ke cricket. 

I: You like cricket. 
B: Yeah that's why . 
I: What about this woman here
 [image of a Muslim woman]? 
B: Wear hijab, because I wear hijab and that meant I cover me. 

I: So you've got the woman to show you wear
 a hijab [head scarf]. What about th is, the 
woman [image of a model]? 
B: Because I like going out and shopping 'cause I'm like fashionable and I like jewellery 
and I like, I like being me. 
I: Let' s go onto how you think other people
 see you. You've put ‚angry', ‚quiet' and 
‚funny' [words]. Why have you used these here? 
B: Becaus e someti mes I might be angry at hom
e and outside and just quiet at school and 
funny at home that's why I put it here. 
I: Is this how you see yourself though? 

B: Er. 

I: Do you see yourself as angry? 

B: Yeah a little bit, but I don't think I'm 
angry every time but other people think I'm 
angry. 
I: And yo u've put Allah in the middle// 
B: //because I'm Muslim and I want to put it there that's why. 

I: So that's important for how you see yourself and// 

B: //yeah. 

I: Do you think there's a difference between the two sides? 
B: Yeah a little bit because I think I'm like 
quiet and funny but ot
her people think I' m 
rude and this thing but just at school because, because you know like I' m new in this 

country? 
I: Yeah. 

B: And then other people bully me and that's why I a bit angry . 

I: So because they bully you? 
B: Yeah. 
I: Why do they bully you? 

B: Becaus e I can't speak properly English a
nd I'm Pakistani, many people like think that 
I' m Muslim and Pakistani and that' s why they curse me.

I: Do you think there is a difference between Pakistani people like you who were born 
over there, and Pakistani people who were born over here? 
B: Yes bit different because in this country some people, er, know like don't care about 
religion, in Pakistan it's been this way but 
in some cities like very hard, very religious 
people in Pakistan that's why. 
I: So you think the Pakistani's here, you don't have anything in common?

B: Many things are common but like, er, you kn
ow in this country the children don't like 
respect teachers and parents but in Pakistan 
it's very big thing, we respect people and 
teachers and parents, we have to, don't act
 with no good people who think like this.

dy with a big smile I done 
this because that shows I'm alway s happy . 
I: So let's go onto how you think other people
 see you. You've just used a picture again 
of a lady smiling. Is that the same, because people see you're happy// 
G: //yeah people see me as happy. 

I: And what about the watch, what does that represent? 

G: When I went through the magazine I found this watch then I thought that's a bit 
fashionable. 
I: Do you think there's a difference between how you see yourself and how you think 
other people see you? 
G: Not that much. 

I: So where would the differences be? 

G: Um. 
I: Like do you think there's any thing about how you see y ourself that y ou think other 
people just don't see// 
G: //no not really. 

I: So y ou don't think there's a difference? 

G: No. 

I: And just finally how would y
ou usually describe y our ethnicity ? 
G: Whenever they [other people] ask me 
I say Turkish ' cause my parents are fr om 
Turkey and I don't really say British or something like that. 
I: So were y ou born over here? 

G: Yeah. 

I: You were born over here but you say// 
G: //I say I'm Turkish. 
I: Why is it important for you to say I'm Tu
rkish instead of saying I'm British or I'm 
English? 



 
324
G: So that people can exactly know where I'm 
from and like what place of the world I'm 
from and that's all. 
I: So do you iden tify mo re with being English or with being Turk ish? 
G: Turkish. 
I: Turkish. 

G: Yeah. 

I: OK that's brilliant. 

 

(D=Daniya, aged 13, female; I=interviewer) 

I: You've done two collages so let's start with
 ‚how I see myself'. Can you just explain 
what the images mean to you, what you're trying to express with them? 
D: Well that one, the top one// 

I: //the baby // 
D: //the baby means that I' m caring. The 
ring and watch means that I like shopping for 
things that suit me and I'm fashionable and 
yet I'm also into fashion, and the make-up 
I like wearing make-up kind of thing. The girl who is like smiling looks like she's 

shy so someti mes I' m shy and stuff, and that
 one's [image of a brown haired woman] 
happy I'm mostly happy. 
I: OK and what about on how you think other people see you because you've just used a 
picture of one lady and a bird. 
D: The bird makes you feel like I'm really, you know birds they fly off everywhere innit 
and they're adventurous and like people thi
nk I'm really adventurous just like my 
friends think that and like, like I don't know how to explain but like they think I'm 

loud like I speak a lot I say all my feelings out. 
I: Who is this lady? 
D: It's just a lady who, who's like, she's st
icking her head out kind of like, she's like, I 
can' t explain it well. 
I: She's quite proud// 

D: //proud, yeah confident, confident. 
I: And that's how you think other people see you// 
D: //other people see me. 

I: But do you feel proud and confident and like you can speak your own mind? 

D: No. 

I: But you think other people see you as quite a confident person? 

D: Yeah. 
I: So do you think that there's a differenc
e between how you see yourself and how you 
think other people see you? 
D: Yeah 'cause I'm not really adventurous like going off to places and, and. 

I: And other people think you're 
a lot mo re confident and assertive// 
D: //yeah// 
I: //and maybe a stronger person than you actually feel that you are// 
D: //yeah, yeah, I'm like shy and quiet. 

I: OK and just finally how would you usually describe your ethnicity? 

D: I would describe myself as Pakistani like. 

I: You would say Pakistani? 

D: Yeah 'cause that's my culture and like 
my parents were brought up there like I was 
brought up here but still I respect my faith. 
I: So is it important to you to say I'm Pakistani? 

D: Not really. 

I: But then why do you say it? 

D: 'Cause, 'cause when peop le see me th ey
 think that I'm Pakis tani 'cause I look 
Pakistani yeah and stuff but I call myself like both like British and Pakistani, 'cause 
like I was brought up here and I speak this language, but also for one or two years I 

was brought up there and speak that language so. 



 
325
I: But when people ask you, you do usually say I'm Pakistani? 
D: Yeah. 

I: You do? 
D: Yeah. 
I: Is there one that y ou feel more than 
the other? Do you feel more British than 
Pakistani or more Pakistani than British// 
D: //more Pakistani.

Amira,13,"I: OK Amira you've done two collages, so let's start with ‚how I see myself'. Do you 
want to explain what pictures you've used and why you've used them? 
A: I've used that [image of blue colour] 
'cause I think I'm a bit, I'm in a good mood at 
times and the grey like I can be a b
it horrible when I'm in the mood. 
I: OK. 

A: And there's a heart because I'm caring and that is [image of a bank] because I like the 
music and, I don't know. 
I: What about that, is it a rapper? 

A: Yeah, Snoop Dog. 

I: Why have you used Snoop Doggy Dog? 

A: He's good at rap and stuff and I'm always
 writing and alway s like thinking about new 
stuff to write. 
I: Let's move onto how you think other pe
ople see you. You've just used the word 
‚glamorous' and a picture of a baby, what do they// 
A: //people think of me like cute and glamorous and I look nice and I can be caring at 
times. 
I: OK// 
A: //but I also look like an ordinary person and happy. 
I: You've just said that you think you look like an ordinary person, but it is also very 
obvious that you are religious because you are wearing a headscarf// 
A: //yeah// 

I: //do you think that people think about that when they see you? Do you think they 
might look at you and think she's Muslim or do you think that isn't what they see 
first? What do you think that they see? 
A: Yeah I think they do see that I'm Mus
lim because of my headscarf and the way I look 
and that but I'm not really sure. 
I: Do you think when people look at you then that they see the headscarf as a good thing 
or a bad thing? 
A: They see it as a good thing 'cause they know th at I'm religious and you're part of 
your religion and you know what your religion is about. 
I: So you think that when people 
see that that's a positive thing? 
A: Yeah. 

I: Do y ou think there are any differences between how you see yourself and how you 
think other people see you? 
A: Um. 
I: Not just from what you've done but what y ou think. 

A: Um (long pause), I don't know. How do you mean, how other people think of me? 

I: Yes. (pause) Do you think they have an
 impression of you, like when they see you, 
that is maybe not how you see yourself? 
A: Yeah, but they might have a different opinion to me as in that I can be horrible at 
times but other people might think that I can't be because I'm Pakistani but I can be 

kind and caring and stuff like that, that's what I think. 



 
326
I: And just going back to ‚how I see myself'.
 Your religion is obviously important to 
you because you do wear the headscarf, but you've not put anything about that under 

how you see yourself. 
A: I don't really see myself 'cause, I don't really see myself as religi ous 'cause I don't 
really do I always have stuff yeah. 
I: So it's just so normal, who you are, you don't think about it? 

A: Yeah I don't really think about it 'cause I don't, OK it is important to me like that. I 
don't think of what others, not like one of the main that I think about it a lot. 
I: Right. And just finally how you would usually describe your ethnicity? 
A: Asian or Pakistani. 
I: What one would you usually use? 

A: I'd say Asian, I'm an Asian. 

I: You would say Asian, or Pakistani sometimes? 

A: Yeah. 
I: So when would you say Pakistani and when would you say Asian? 
A: If people ask me as in like where do your 
parents come from and like what culture 
you are I always say yeah I'm Pakistani but like if somebody, like if people look at 

me and say what type of race and stuff are you I say that I'm Asian and stuff. 
I: Were you born over here though? 
A: Yeah I'm British Asian. 
I: But do you always say British Asian? 

A: No I don' t. 

I: Do you identify with British or do you identify with being Asian? 

A: I would say Asian, I'm just an Asian. 

I: That's what you identify with most? 
A: Yeah. 
I: Yeah? 

A: Yeah. 

I: OK that's brilliant. 

 
(H=Henry, aged 13, male; I=interviewer) 


I: You've just done one collage yes// 

H: //yeah// 

I: //‚how I see myself'. Do you just want to 
explain to me why you've used each of the 
pictures, what you are trying to express about yourself with them? So let's start with 
the mobile, why did you use the mobile? 
H: Because I, I like it. 

I: You like the mobile. 

H: Yeah. 

I: OK and what about, you've got pictures of cars. Why did you use pictures of cars? 
H: Becaus e I like cars and I like racing. 
I: So if I was going to use some words to describe the type of person that you see 
yourself as, how you see yourself, what words would you use? 
H: Um. 

I: Like do you think you're loud, angry,
 fun or hard-working or, how do you see 
yourself? 
H: I think like hard-working and not loud. 
I: Not loud. 

H: No. 

I: So quiet. 

H: Yeah. 
I: Now you didn't do anything on the other side, do you think that when other people 
see you// 
H: //yeah// 



 
327
I: //do you think the way they see you is th
e same way as how you see yourself? (pause) 
Like when they look at you do you think that they see someone who is quiet? 
H: Yeah. 
I: You do. 
H: Yeah. 

I: Do you think that other people might think something, like they might think 
something about what type of person you are that you don't feel you are? 
H: Yeah. 

I: Like what? 
H: I don't know. 
I: And just finally I asked you about your ethnicity and you said Bulgarian. 

H: Yeah. 

I: Were you born here or were you born in Bulgaria? 

H: In Bulgaria. 
I: You were born in Bulgaria. 
H: Yeah. 

I: So how long have you been here? How many years or months? 

H: One and seven. 

I: Nearly two years? 
H: Yeah. 
I: Do you say you are Bulgarian or do you think that you are British? What one do you 
feel more? 
H: Bulgarian and British. 

I: You feel both? 

H: Yeah. 
I: What are the differences, do you think ther
e is a difference between being Bulgarian 
and British? 
H: Yeah. 

I: What's the difference? 

H: I like my country more, and I like it more here. 
I: So do you miss your country? 
H: No not that much. 

I: You don't miss your country that much, but it's important for you to say you are from 
Bulgaria so people know where you are from? 
H: Yeah. 

I: OK that's brilliant.

(D=David, aged 13, male; I=interviewer) 


I: So let's start with your collage David. Do you want to just explain what pictures 
you've used on the ‚how I see myself' side 
and what they mean to you, what they 
represent? 
D: OK I've got a picture of Gordon Brown who is like the Prime Ministers PA or 
whatever it is, and he wants someone dead he wants to be// 
I: //he wants who dead? 

D: Tony Blair. 

I: OK. 
D: I've got a picture of Tony Blair 
because he's like all powerful like me. 
I: In what way do you think you're powerful? 

D: My voice. I'm very opinionated. 

I: Why? 

D: Because, because// 

I: //do you think Tony Blair is opinionated? 
D: Sort of, but he lies a lot as well. 
I: He lies a lot. 

D: Yeah. 

I: About? 

D: Policies. 
I: So do you think he's a good figure or a bad figure? 
D: Probably a bad one. 

I: But that's part of how you see yourself? 

D: Yeah. And this little assassination guy he
re has some, load of guns, I'm gonna grow 
up to be a murderer. 
I: A murderer? 
D: M mm. 

I: What about the puppy though and the heart and the penguin, because they're quite 
soft compared to the other images? 
D: The penguin is just my favourite animal so. 

I: Why is it your favourite animal? 
D: Don't know, just is. And the little ‚break my
 heart' [words] thing, I don't know why I 
put it on there I just kind of stuck it on there. 
I: Does it mean anything to you? 

D: No. And the little puppy just, that's just I've got dogs. 

I: That you've got dogs? 
D: M mm. 
I: And what about the ‚touch' [word]? 

D: It's all shiny and stuff like that so, y eah it's kind of loud. 

I: Loud? 

D: Yeah. 

I: Does the word touch represent anything 
for you? Is there a reason why you chose 
that word? 
D: No. 

I: So it was the shininess? 

D: Yeah. 

I: Let's move onto ‚how I thi
nk other people see me'. Let's start off with the image of 
the tiger, the fly and the eagle. What do they mean? 
D: The little tiger means, I don't know, free and loud and you know do what you want to 
do. And the crazy wacky fly thing represents madness and freaky looking. 
I: Freaky looking ? 



 
329
D: Yeah, and mad. 
I: What about the eagle? 

D: The eagle represents freedom. 
I: Freedom? 
D: Yeah and you know same as the tiger really. 

I: OK and what's this image [i
mage of a little monkey ] here? 
D: It's a monkey. 

I: A monkey. What does a monkey mean to you? 

D: It represents my Chinese year, monkey, the year of the monkey. 
I: And we've got Dracula here. 
D: Dracula represents kind of like evil. 

I: What was that? 

D: Evil. 

I: Evil in what way? 
D: Because I can be really sound, but then if someone gets on the wrong side of me I can 
be nasty and evil. 
I: You can be sound but// 

D: //yeah, but then if they get on the wrong side of me I can be evil. 

I: You've also got the word ‚wild' here four times why is that? 
D: I don't know, just wild, it just wild. More wild. 
I: Now I've noticed on this side, on how you think other people see you, you've 
actually used quite a lot of i mages from 
nature, like animals. Why is that? 
D: I've just always liked nature so you k
now, like animals have a lot in common with 
people really don't they personality wise. 
I: Animals have a lot in common with people personality wise? 
D: Yeah. 
I: Do you think there's a difference between how you think other people see you and 
how you see yourself? 
D: A bit yeah but then// 

I: //in what way? 
D: Because like, I don't know really just, I don't know. 
I: Because here [how I think other pe
ople see me] you've put down evil and quite 
freaky and wild. Do you think they are positives, that they are good things that 

people see in you, or do you think that people see them as bad things? 
D: People, some people may see them as bad things and some people may see them as 
good because like maybe like the teachers a
nd stuff see me, you know, like as wild or 
something like that, see me as bad and stuff like 
that but really I'm just a kid trying to 
have some fun and they don't understand that so. 
I: If you had more time are there any extra pictures that you would have put on your 
collage? 
D: Yeah. 
I: Like? 
D: Loads. 

I: Such as? 

D: Just some different pictures of, maybe some more animals and stuff like that. 

I: And just one more thing, I noticed on how you see yourself you've put down a 
picture that you said represented mu rder. 
D: Yeah. 
I: Why do you see that as part of how you see yourself? 

D: Because, like, because sometimes I get really
 angry and stuff like that and I feel like 
killing people like Richard [pupil]. 
I: OK, just one more question, how would you describe your ethnicity? 
D: British. 
I: Is that how you always describe your ethnicity? 

D: Yeah.

Richard,13,"I: Richard, let's start with ‚how I see my
self'. Do you want to discuss the images 
you've chosen? 
R: I have an image of some fashionable people because to mysel f I think I'm very 
fashionable. I also have a picture of something saying ‚I want a f***ing baby' 

[words] because it' s funny and I see myself as a humorous person (laughter in room). 
I: What about the Brad Pitt head? 
R: I think I resemble Brad Pitt in many ways 
and the body that I have there I think is 
exactly the same except mine has a few mo
r e packs on there (laughter in room). 
I: Right. Thinking about this side, a
bout how you see yourself, now I know you'v e 
been laughing but are these things that you genuinely think you are, or are they things 
that you aspire to, that you want to be like that? 
R: Well David [pupil] told me to say yes to that I think I am, but I think I aspire. 

I: You aspire to// 

R: //except that one. 

I: Except the humorous one. 
R: Yes. 
I: So inside you aspire to be fashionable and have a body like that and look like Brad 
Pitt? 
R: Yes. 

I: OK let's move onto this side ‚how I think ot
her people see me'. Would you like to go 
through the images here? 
R: Well I have a picture of Matt Lucas on one of his sketches of Andy [
Little Britain
 
character ] the matey in the wh
eelchair because I think people find me quite funny at 
times. Also have some words saying ‚lots on his plate' because I think people see me 

as fat. I also have a picture of Dafydd Thomas [
Little Britain
 character] because he's 
gay and people so metime s see me a s ga y. I have a p icture of Kat Slater [
EastE nders
 
character] because she's feisty and people think I'm feisty, and then I have a picture 
of Hitler because people think I am cruel at times to certain people. 
I: And you've also written in the middle. What does this say? 

R: ‚Me, myself and I' and ‚King Richard'. 

I: Now looking at your collage there's quite a difference between this side [how I think 
other people see me] and how I see myself. What do you think on the whole people 
see you as? 
R: Um. 

I: Do you think they have a high opinion of you or a negative opinion? 

R: A bit of both, it depends on who it is. Some people have a low opinion. 

I: Such as who? 
R: People like Prateech, Han nah Pond [pupils] 
and people I don't like, and some people 
such as David [pupil] has a positive image about me. 
I: And you've also used images of women to show fashionable [how I see myself]. 

R: Yeah. 

I: Why did you choose to women and not images of men? 

R: Because I couldn't find any men that looked fashionable. 
I: You couldn't find any men that looked fashionable? 
R: No. Not like that anyway (laughing). 

I: Also the Hitler image and ‚cruel at times' [words], wh en can you be cruel? Or do you 
feel you're a cruel person? 
R: Sometimes to Hannah Pond [pupil] yes because we don' t get along so I quite a lot 
cruel to her and she's cruel back. To Prateech [pupil], I admit I will admit I am a bit 
racial to him at times I have been. 
I: Why are you racist to him? 



 
331
R: I don't know I've just been like, if I've b
een sat next to him I've said to David [pupil] 
before he smells or curry or something 
just mucking around which, if you think about 
it you know it is out of order but at the time it was just a funny thing to say but it 
doesn' t mean anything. 
I: OK. If you had more time to work on 
y our collage are there an y more pictures tha t 
you would have liked to have put on there? 
R: Yes, I would have put a picture of Martin Luther King. 

I: Why? 

R: He was a hero because he stood up for what he believed is right. 
I: And which side [of the collage] would you have put that on? 
R: In the middle. 

I: In the middle? 

R: Yes. 

I: And what else? 
R: I cannot think at the mo ment, I can only think of Martin Luther King. 
I: Also, how would you usually describe your ethnicity? 

R: Richard come from China (mimicking Chinese accent). 

I: Why do you say Chinese? 

R: Because it's funny (mimicking Chinese accent) . 
I: Where are your parents from? 
R: British, Britain (mimicking Chinese accent). 

I: They are both British? 

R: Yeah (mimicking Chinese accent). 

I: But you say Chinese? 

R: Yeah (mimicking Chinese accent). 
I: And you say Chinese because? 
R: It's funny (mimicking Chinese a ccent). 

I: It's funny? 

R: Yeah (mimicking Chinese accent). 

I: So you regard being Chinese as being f
unny? You think being Chinese is funny? 
R: I think if teachers s ay where come from I'll always say Chinese and put on an accent 
because I think it's funny at the time. 
I. OK, thank y ou.

self' and just explain what images yo u've 
used and why? 
D: I've used, um// 

I: //what's this an image of? 

D: PlayStation portable because I like playing like games and on PlayStation. 
I: And yo u've also got an image of an eagle there. 
D: Because I'm not like, I don't really talk much but I normally just watch so. 

I: So you don't really talk much and you just observe// 

D: //yeah. 

I: So is that why you've got the word ‚quiet' there? 

D: Yeah, quiet. 
I: Now let's go onto ‚how I think other peopl
e see me'. You've not used any images 
you've only got the words ‚quiet' and ‚tall'. Why is that? 
D: Because probably people don't really know me that much because I don't speak 
(pause). 
I: Let's move back to ‚how I see myself'. 
If you could have put more images on this to 
express how you see yourself what types of things, if you had more time, would types 
of things would you have put down? 
D: Um (long pause), I don't know.

you observe. Is there any more to how you see yourself?

I: Controllers. Because? 

S: Because I like gaming and things like that. 

I: Gaming? 
S: Yeah. 
I: OK. 

S: And I've got pictures of cars and the word
 ‚Porsche' because cars runs in my family

type of music and things and I've got th
e colour black because that' s my favourite 
colour. 
I: Let's go back to the picture of Morrissey
. What exactly is it about Morrissey and his 
music that you like? 
S: I like the way he, the way he writes and how
 it means things to him, that's important 
for me. 
I: And are there any particular songs or albums or messages that you get from 
Morrissey that really stand out for you? 
S: Yeah there is like one of them 
Meat is Murder
 that is getting cross about killing 
animals and things, it's not very nice and 
things and that's what made most people 
become vegetarians. 
I: Are you a vegetarian? 

S: No. 
I: So you're not vegetarian but you respect// 
S: //I respect his view of it. 

I: What is it about Morrissey's character that you like? 

S: I like the fact that he keeps himself to 
himself and he keeps himself as a mys terious 
and private person. 
I: As a mysterious person. 
S: Yeah. 

I: And do you think that is a good quality or bad quality? 

S: Good quality because you don't want anyone to know anything about you. 

I: Do you feel you share that in common with Morrissey? 

S: Kind of. 
I: In what way? 
S: In sometimes I keep myself to myself and am private but not always, but mainly yes 
so it's kind of the same thing. 
I: When wouldn't you?

333
S: I put the word ‚queen' because some pe
ople say I'm posh because to do with my 
family and everything. 
I: And what's the ‚evil' [word] there for? 
S: Well so me pe ople say that I'm evil so me times so. 
I: In what way? Or do you understand why they say that? 

S: Yeah I understand why they say it but they're just messing about sometimes. 

I: So they are usually saying it just because they are messing about? 

S: Yeah, or they are annoyed at me. 

I: So it's just a sort of a form of abuse th
at they are throwing at you, like a name that 
they are calling you? 
S: Yeah. 

I: What about this little picture here [image of flies]? 

S: Well most people say I'm annoying so I put pictures of flies because people find them 
annoying. 
I: Do you th ink you are annoying? 
S: Sometime s, not alway s though. 

I: If you had more time to work on this collage are there any other images that you 
would have liked to have put down? 
S: Yeah pictures of animals and things like that. 
I: Pictures of animals and things lik
e that. What types of animals? 
S: Not sure about that. 

I: What would the animals mean and which side would they go on? 

S: They'd go on both sides. 

I: And what would they be used to 
express, why would you be using them? 
S: Just need to express the way I am. 
I: Can you give me an example? 
S: Intelligent and things. 

I: Intelligent and things. 

S: Yeah. 

I: I've also noticed that, apart from Morrissey, you haven't used many images of media 
celebrities or films or programmes. Why is that? 
S: Because I don't tend to watch thi
ngs like that, I' m not interested. 
I: So is Morrissey the only person who you feel you can relate to and expresses part of 
you? 
S: Yeah and other singers like that. 

I: Such as? 
S: Nick Cave. 
I: Nick Cave. So if you had an image of 
Nick Cave you'd have maybe put an image of 
him next to Morrissey? 
S: Yeah. 

I: Just finally, how would you usually describe your ethnicity? 
S: British. 
I: Do you always say British? 

S: Yeah. 

I: That's brilliant. Just one more question 
about ‚posh' [how I think other people see 
me], do you think when other people see you 
as posh that's a positive or a negative? 
S: I'm not sure, it depends how they aim it at me. 
I: How they aim it at you? 
S: Yeah, the sound when they're angry you know or something or they're just messing 
about. 
I: So it depends on the context, when they say it and how they say it to you? 

S: Yeah. 
I: Do you see yourself as posh? 
S: Not really. 

I: No? 



 
334
S: No. 
I: OK that's brilliant. Thanks.

I: You've got a few images under ‚how I see
 myself'. Could you explain these ones 
first please? 
D: I've got th e PSP, I'm into gaming. ‚Loud 
but quiet' [words] be
cause I'm quite loud, 
sometimes quiet. Blue is my favourite colour. 
I: I've noticed in the middle you've got a pi
cture of, I think he's a Chinese man. Why 
have you used that? 
D: People sort of normally call me Chinese. 

I: People// 

D: //Chinese. They call me Chinese. 
I: They call you Chinese. Why do you think they call you Chinese? 
D: Because of my Asian background. 

I: You've got an Asian background? 

D: Yeah. 

I: Do you think when people call you Chinese that they are saying it in a positive or a 
negative way? 
D: I'm not sure. More like they're just asking. 

I: They're just asking? 

D: Yeah. 

I: So what else does that picture represen
t [image of a Chinese man]? What are you 
expressing with that? 
D: I' m not sure. 
I: You' re not sure? 

D: Yeah. 

I: Does that picture reflect how you see yourself? 

D: Yeah. Long hair, glasses, Asian. 
I: Long hair, glasses, Asian. What about his dress? 
D: Normally wear shirts, I used to wear a tie a lot and jacket// 

I: //and a? 

D: There's a jacket. 

I: And just finally, how would you usually describe your ethnicity? 

D: British, but I have a lot of Asian background. 
I: In what way do you have an Asian background? 
D: I'm not sure what it is. 

I: You're not sure of// 

D: //yeah. 

I: But you always call yourself British? 
D: Yeah. 
I: Would you ever feel, in a situation, you might use the word Asian to describe 
yourself? 
D: No, not unless I was talking about my parents or something like that. 

I: So when you're talking about your parent
s you use the word Asian, but when you talk 
about yourself you say British? 
D: Yeah. 
I: That's excellent. Thank you very much.",6434,22,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
Jane,13,"I: Now you've done two different collages here. Can we start with ‚how I see myself'? 
Can you just explain what these pictures 
are and why you chose them, what they 
mean to you? 



 
335
J: Because they're my favourite animals really. 
I: Right, so you've used a picture of a tiger, a cheetah and some wolves, but why are 
they y our favourite animals? What is it about them that you like? 
J: Just nice (laughs). 
I: They're just nice? 

J: Yeah. 

I: Do you think the animals represent anything, any type of qualities that you like? 

J: Cheetah's fast, I like that. 

I: Cheetahs are fast. 
J: Yeah. 
I: What I'm trying to say is are there any qualities that these animals have that you can 
also see in yourself? Like you ju st said you th ink Cheetahs are fast// 
J: //yeah, I'm a fast runner. 

I: You're a fast runner. 
J: Yeah. 
I: Is there anything else about these animals// 

J: No. 

I: OK, let' s move onto ‚how I think other people see me' . Would you just like to 
explain what we have here? 
J: Most people think I'm fun and stuff. 
I: Most people think// 

J: //think I'm fun and every thing. 

I: And y ou've got the word ‚fun' here. Y
ou've also got this picture here [cartoon] 
which looks like it' s been taken from a Ch
inese or Japanese cartoon. Why have you 
used this picture? 
J: Because I draw like that. That's how I draw. 
I: So y ou feel that other people see 
you as quite an arty-type of person? 
J: Yeah. 

I: You've also got the word ‚calm' he
re. Why do you think other people see you as 
calm? 
J: Because I don' t get stressed sort of really. 
I: You don't get stressed? 

J: No. 

I; And you've written down that you're a 
‚good friend' [words]. Now in amongst the 
arty and the good friend and the calm and 
the fun, you've also written [word 
‚weird']// 
J: //because people think I'm weird. 
I: Because people think you' re weird? 

J: Yeah. 

I: Why do you think people think you are weird? 

J: Well because like, I do stuff differently. 
I: What do you mean by stuff? 
J: Act different. 

I: Act different. Do you think that you act differently? 

J: Yeah, to most people yeah. 

I: But do you think that you're acting differently is weird? 

J: Not to me no. 
I: Not to you? 
J: No. 

I: You just said that if you act differently people think you are weird. Now do you think 
on the whole that if people behave like that, say I have a group of people and one 

person is acting differently// 
J: //they wouldn't call me weird no, but they just do think I'm weird. 
I: OK. If you had more time are there anymore pictures that you would have put down? 

J: Yeah. 



 
336
I: Such as? 
J: I don't know I couldn't find any. 

I: But is there anything else you would have 
liked to have expressed about how you see 
yourself, because here you've got your favourite animals. Is that all as you see 
yourself as? 
J: No. 

I: So what else would you have liked to have put there? 

J: Kind and nice so. 

I: Kind and nice? 
J: Yeah but I couldn't find anything. 
I: If you could, can you think of any images
 that you would have used to represent kind 
and nice? 
J: No, I couldn't think of anything that I could put for that sort of thing. 

I: I've also noticed on y our collage that y ou'
ve not used any pictures of films or famous 
people. Is there a reason for that? 
J: No. 

I: No? 

J: I just didn't. 

I: You just didn't. 
J: No I couldn't find any. 
I: You couldn't find any you liked? 

J: Yeah. 

I: And just finally, how do you describe y our ethnicity? (pause) Yo u wrote British, is 
British how you always usually describe yourself? 
J: Yeah I co me from here so I just say that. 
I: You were born in England? 
J: Yeah. 

I: So you call yourself British? 

J: Yeah. 

I: Where are your parents from? 
J: My dad is from Singapore and my mum is from here. 
I: Your dad is from Singapor
e and y our mum is fro m here. 
J: Yeah. 

I: So your dad has an Asian background. 

J: Yeah. 

I: Do you ever call yourself Asian? 
J: Don't think it. No, I do know I've got sort of like Asian sort of, but don't like to 
describe myself as it. 
I: You don't describe yourself as that you describe yourself// 

J: //no I just say one thing. 

I: Say one thing? 
J: Yeah. 
I: British? 

J: Yeah. 

I: OK that's brilliant. Thanks. 

 

(N=Natalie, aged 13, female; I=interviewer) 

I: You've done two collages here. Let's star
t with ‚how I see myself' , would you like to 
just talk through the images? 
N: I like that picture [image of a dove] most of all because// 

I: //the picture of the dove// 
N: //yeah because I'm a free spirit so I like doing and saying wild things. 
I: Wild things. 

N: Trying new stuff. 



 
337
I: OK and what about the squirrel there? 
N: I like animals. 

I: You like animals? 
N: Yeah and I like nature. 
I: What about the picture of Charlotte Church? 

N: She's a famous person and some people have their like an idol to look up to. 

I: Do you identify with Charlotte Church? 

N: Yeah. I don't agree with th
e stuff in the press it's just// 
I: //with what stuff in the press? 
N: Like they say that she's bad and I just like Charlotte Church. 
I: What is it about her that you identify with and look up to? 

N: Her singing. 

I: Just her singing? What about her fashion and the way she looks? 

N: Yeah, she doesn't look exactly like a pop st
ar I think she just looks like herself she 
just doesn't make herself look like what anyone wants her to. Yeah, she doesn't want 
to act like anyone else. 
I: Is that a quality that you like about Charlotte Church? Is that what you see in 
yourself? 
N: Yeah. I'm not told to do what anyone else I just do what I want to do. 
I: OK let's move onto this image of a little 
black girl. Why have you used this here? 
N: Because it's a little kid and I like, I don'
t know I just thought it was cute and I think 
I'm cute. 
I: And you've also got the words// 

N: //'saucy'// 

I: //‚saucy' and ‚pussycat'. Why are these words here? 
N: I don't know I just I saw them in the paper and they, they kind of stand out from the 
rest of the writing. 
I: So// 

N: //I like things that stand out like I stand out. 

I: So it's not so much the words and what they mean// 
N: //no. They're the words that are big and bold and they make it stand out. 
I: And that follows through I assume in th
e mobiles and the ‚loud and proud' [words]? 
N: Yeah. 

I: What are you trying to say with loud and// 

N: //I'm very loud and I don't care about if I'm quiet it's just that I'm very, Jane [pupil] 
will tell you I'm loud. 
I: What was that? 
N: I'm loud. 

I: You're loud? 

N: Yeah and I don't mind people saying you have
 to be quiet, I can be quiet sometime s 
but I prefer being loud and out with what I think with other people. 
I: OK let's move onto this side; how you think other people see you. Now it's 
interesting because you've not used any pict
ures you've just used words, so would 
you like to go through the words? 
N: I think I'm sometimes calm, I'm not always I'm normally very angry sometimes. 
Sometimes I feel mental and I can be wicked
 and I can just make all my friends laugh 
if they're grumpy. I' m spoilt sometimes, sometimes like my friends spoil me and my 
parents, I'm a brat to them and I can really care for people if they're really upset I can 
help them. 
I: So you're loving? 

N: Yeah. 

I: On this side [how I think other people 
see me ] if there were any pictures that y ou 
could have used here, what pictures would you have used? 
N: Something that stands out, like other pe
ople standing in the background and someone 
standing right in the middle looking really unusual. 



 
338
I: I've also noticed apart from Charlotte C
hurch you've not used any other pictures of 
famous people. Why is that? 
N: I'm not really into famous people. I don't look at the gossip, I just like sometimes 
being quiet with the gossip. 
I: Do you think there's a difference between how you see yourself and how you think 
other people see you. 
N: A little bit of difference yeah. 

I: What is the difference? 

N: Um. 
I: What would you say is the difference? 
N: About the famous people? 

I: No, just overall// 

N: //I don't know, there's not much difference. 

I: So do you think there is not that much of a difference? 
N: I don't think there's not a lot of differen
ce they're the same kind of yeah, I think that 
both sides are nearly the same. 
I: Both sides are nearly the same? 

N: Yeah. 

I: Is that how you feel, that both sides are the same? Or do you think that there are 
differences t hat maybe there are things in how you see yourself that other people 
don't see, or that there are things that other people see that you don't see in yourself? 
N: No I think other people see me as I don't see myself, sometimes I don't see or hear 
what other people think of me. 
I: Sometimes you don't? 

N: I don't know what other people think of me. 
I: Does that bother you// 
N: //not really. I don't care what other people think sometimes. 

I: Sometimes, you keep saying so
metimes. When would you care? 
N: When I most care like, when you're asking what your friends think and they're not 
giving you an honest opinion and they think it's a joke or if you really ask them if 
they do care. 
I: OK and just finally, how would you usually describe your ethnicity? 

N: British. 

I: British. 

N: Yeah. 

I: You always describe yourself as British? 
N: Yeah. 
I: Just so I know, what does being British mean to you? What is British? 

N: I don't know, it's just I think where you're born that's where you must put your 
ethnicity. 
I: So it's where you are born? 
N: Yeah. 
I: And? 

N: I don't know it's just where y ou're born and where you grow up and I've been 
brought up in Britain. 
I: OK that's excellent. Thank you. 

 
(L=Lisa, aged 13, female; I=interviewer) 


I: You've done two separate collages here. Ca
n we just start with ‚how I see myself' 
and can you just explain what pictures you've used and why you've used them? 
L: Well I've used these two pictures to explain what type of music I'm into. 
I: Who are they? 
L: That's 50 Cent and that's The Game. 

I: The Game? 



 
339
L: Yeah. 
I: OK. 

L: And a love heart to show that like I care and I'm loving and everything and a candle 
to show that I can relax and like I'm really peaceful. 
I: Yes, peaceful. 

L: And a little tiger as well, animals and Ma
n United as well they're my favourite team. 
I: Is it tigers specifically that you like or is it// 

L: //it's like every animal but tigers just 
show its like, I don't know, just tigers. 
I: What is it about tigers that you like? 
L: That how they 're so vicious but th
ey look so cute at the same time. 
I: Do you think that there are any qualities about a tiger that reflect how you see 
yourself? Have they got any characteristics or qualities that you think you share? 
L: Well everyone thinks I can be nasty when
 I wanna be and practically I won' t change. 
I: Now just going back to 50 Cent and The Game, what type of music is it that y ou are 
into? 
L: I like rap music and R&B and everything like that. 

I: Rap music an d R&B. 

L: Yeah. 

I: If you could have put anymore pictures 
onto this side [how I see myself], what 
pictures would you have used? 
L: Um. 

I: Or are there any that you would have used? 

L: Not really. 

I: No? 

L: No. 
I: OK we'll move onto this side, ‚how I think 
other people see me'. I'd like to start off 
with this picture of the young bl
ack girl. Why is that there? 
L: Because I love little kids and just like 
little babies and every thing and it just shows 
that I care about all the younger ones. 
I: And why did you use that picture of that girl in particular? 
L: Because she just caught my eye and she's like very pretty and everything so. 
I: And we've also got Britney Spears. Why is Britney Spears there? 

L: Well one of my friends said that whenever she listens to Britney Spears I just come 
into her head so I thought well if that's
 what she sees me as and I put it there. 
I: What do you think it is about Britney Spears that makes y our friend think about you? 

L: Well I like singing and Britney Spears altogether so. 
I: Do you think that's a good thing being thought of as Britney Spears? 
L: Yeah. 

I: What characteristics does she have that you think are good, so you don't mind if 
people see you as// 
L: She's pretty and like she's famous and sh
e just like, she's good at acting good at 
singing and everything like that so. 
I: You've also got the words ‚loud' and 
‚funny'. Why do you think other people see 
you as loud and funny? 
L: Because I'm always laughing at like everything I say and like joke about everything 
and I'm always shouting a lot as well so. 
I: Do you think that there's a differen
ce between how you see yourself and how you 
think other people see you? 
L: Yeah. 

I: What are the differences? 

L: Well, I'm loud and thing but they [other people] just don't see the side of me that my 
family does. 
I: Because here [how I se e my self] I noticed that y ou've got the candle and y ou've got 
the heart so that's actually quite, as you sai
d, quite calming and 
relaxing and loving, 



 
340
and that doesn't seem to feature on this side [how I t hink other people see me]. Do 
you think that that's the biggest difference? 
L: Yeah. 
I: Does it ever bother you that other people don't see that? 
L: Sometimes. 

I: When would it bother you? 

L: Sometimes I just think about it and reali
se that no-one else can see it. It makes me 
think. 
I: And just finally, how woul
d you usually describe ethnicity? 
L: English. 
I: On your form you wrote British, but which one would you usually use? 

L: English. 

I: You'd say English. 

L: Yeah. 
I: Why would you use English as opposed to British? 
L: I don't know it's just, I think it's easier to say because British sounds posh. 

I: British sounds posh? 

L: Yeah. 

I: And English? 
L: I don't know. 
I: What does being English mean to you? 

L: That I' m alright with that. 

I: That you're// 

L: //I'm alright with that but// 

I: // you're alright with that? 
L: Yeah, but I've got Welsh in me as well. 
I: But you don't mention that? 

L: No I don't want anybody to know I'm Welsh. 

I: Why not? 

L: Because of their reputation? 
I: What is their reputation? 
L: Um (laughter). 

I: So y ou call yourself English? 

L: Yeah. 

I: That's excellent.",14375,23,23.0,"Self-Perception, Others' Perception, Cultural Identity, Emotional Expression, Hobbies and Interests, Youth and Image, Self-Identity Conflict, Emotional Complexity, Perception by Others, Artistic Expression, Identity and Self-Perception, Emotional Self-Perception",0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1
Sarah,13,"I: Let's start with ‚how I see myself'. Do you 
want to talk through some of the pictures 
that you've used? Let's start with Mariah Carey. 
S: I have a picture of her because I like her music and stuff like that, her voice and 
listening to music. 
I: You've also got a flower and a heart there. What do they mean? 

S: Like the heart is for a lot of loving, and 
that's [image of flowers] that's like loving 
for, that's like loving. 
I: OK so the flower is also for loving? 

S: Yeah. 
I: Who is that [image of Nikki Sanderson]? 
S: Candice. 

I: Candice from 
Coronation Street
. 
S: Yes. 

I: Why did you use a picture of her? 
S: To show that I'm, I think I'm quite trendy
 in clothes that I wear and she's got trendy 
clothes on. 



 
341
I: Let's go back to Mariah Carey. Now 
you said you like her music, is there anything 
else about her as a person that you like? 
S: Pretty , I don't know. 
I: When you see her in interviews or you 
see her talk, do you think that she's a nice 
person? 
S: Yeah. 

I: Why do you think she's a nice person? 

S: I don't know. 

I: So you just like her, you like 
her music. Do y ou like her fashion? 
S: Yeah. 
I: So is there part of you that sees yourself as 
identify ing with Mariah Carey , or do y ou 
see her as somebody that you look up to and aspire to be like? 
S: Aspire to be like. 

I: In what ways? 
S: Just like pretty and a singer and things like that. 
I: Pretty and singing. 

S: Yeah. 

I: OK let's move onto ‚how I think other people see me'. You've used a picture of a 
little baby, a black child, a little boy. Why is that there? 
S: Just to show I'm caring and I love child
ren and other people think that I'm good with 
children. 
I: Other people think you're good with children. 

S: Yeah they think I'm caring . 

I: You're caring. 

S: Yeah. 
I: We've also got a butterfly here and so
me more flowers. What do these mean? 
S: I've put more flowers 'cause other peopl
e think I'm loving and a butterfly because 
I'm quiet out with my mates most of the time I'm quiet. 
I: You're quiet? 

S: Yeah. 
I: Let's go to Sharon Osbourne. 
S: People say I can be cheeky sometimes and I think Sharon's quite cheeky so I put a 
picture of her. 
I: And we've got Jordan as well. Is it Jord
an here or Katie Price that you think other 
people see y ou as? 
S: Katie. People think that I'm pretty and I, I just put a picture of her because I think 
she's quite pretty. 
I: Is there anything else about her, any othe
r characteristics that her or Sharon Osbourne 
have, like anything about their persona
lity, that you think people look at you and 
they see that in y our personality as well? 
S: Don't know. 
I: Because I've noticed here you've used a picture of Sharon Osbourne. Now S h aron 
Osbourne can be quite loud but you've got the picture of a butterfly and// 
S: //yeah that's from I'm quiet when I'm w
ith my mates and that, but then sometimes I 
can be cheeky and I thought Sharon's quite cheeky. 
I: Right and you've also, in the middle, you've got words explaining what all the 
images mean. Now do you think there's a difference between how you see yourself 
and how other people see you? 
S: I don't know. 

I: Because I've noticed here you've got loving on both sides, we've got pretty on both 
sides, we've not got the fashionable on how
 you think other people see you. Do you 
think other people see you as fashionable? 
S: Yeah. 
I: You do? 

S: Yeah. 



 
342
I: But we've not got the relaxing? 
S: Because like when I'm at home alone and 
that I'm a lot relaxed and when I'm with 
my mates and things like that I'm not like it, I don't relax and stuff. 
I: So do you think that other people don't see that side of you? 
S: No. 

I: They don't. 

S: No. 

I: Is that because you don't want them to or because// 

S: //I don't know, I just prefer to be on my own. 
I: You just// 
S: //prefer to be on my own when I'm like relaxing. 

I: If you could add any more pictures to this what pictures would you add and why? 

S: I don't know. 

I: You don't know? 
S: No. 
I: Just finally, how do you usually describe your ethnicity? 

S: English. 

I: English. Do you always say English? 

S: Yeah. 
I: Do you ever describe yourself as British? 
S: No. 

I: Why not? 

S: I just don't. 

I: You just don't. 

S: English comes into my head first. 
I: OK that's brilliant thanks.

I: What do the images me an? 

L: Well I've got like the cat and the bird b
ecause sometimes, you know I get a little you 
know, don't feel as you know as happy as you normally do. If I get upset about 

something I sometimes take it out on other people. 
I: So that's the cat and the bird. You've al
so got some more pictures of nature like the 
bears and the wolves and the other little 
cat and the beaver, what do they all 
represent? 
L: Well the bear was like have babies and thi
ngs it's I, I do like being in a group and if 
I'm with my friends and that I just I'm mo
re socialised with family and that, mo re 
comfortable being in a group. 
I: And what about the wolves? 
L: Sometimes like a wolf will sometimes go 
by itself and I like to be alone, I don't feel 
as tatty and that, you'd rather just sit by yourself. 
I: What about these pictures, is that Orlando Bloom? 

L: Yeah. 

I: What does Orlando Bloom mean? 
L: I don't know, I just like him (laughs). 
I: What about this image [image of Kelly Clarkson]? Who is it? 

L: Kelly Clarkson I think. 

I: Why have you put there? 

L: I just like, I like her singing and most of her songs are like basically what she does 
and things. 
I: What she does? 

L: Just singing and everything.

I: OK and what about her [image of Catherine Tate]? 
L: Don't know what her name is but she does a comedy sort of thing so// 

I: //am I bothered [catchphrase of comedian]? 
L: Yeah (laughing). Sometimes I sort of feel as though I could be quite funny and then 
other times you know. 
I: What does this mean [image of a man kissing another man on cheek]? 

L: I sort of, I care about my friends and everything. 

I: What about this pot of yoghurt? 

L: I don't know, I can't remember, I had a reason I can't remember now. 
I: Let's just move to this side [how I 
think other people see me]. We've got Jennifer 
Aniston, why is she there? 
L: It's not really because of her it's b
ecause of the face she's making, like because I 
thought sometimes people can see me as 
quite moody sometimes and like you know 
one minute you're happy and the next minute y our like nah// 
I: Quite moody? 
L: Yeah. 

I: Right. What about the girl in the middle [image of Raven Baxter]? 

L: Oh she does like a humour thing as well. I just thought people can see me as funny 
sometimes. 
I: Do you think she's pulling a funny expressi
on there, do you think that's a funny face 
that she's pulling? 
L: I don't know, not really , but she has this show that's funny so. 

I: She has this? 

L: Show. 

I: Who is it? 
L: I don't know what her name is, I think y
eah, I don't know what her real name is but 
she has this show called// 
I: //
That's So Raven
. 
L: Yeah. 

I: What about the cat again on this side? 
L: Well I like cats and like all animals as well but, some people said to me I don't know 
why that I remind them of a cat for some reason and I thought oh well I might as well 

put it down. 
I: What do you think it is about a cat// 

L: //I don't know. 

I: You don't know? 
L: No. 
I: If there were any mo re pictures you could 
have put on this side [how I think other 
people see me], what would you have put? 
L: I'd have put, someti mes people can see me as all cari ng someti mes . 

I: Caring? 
L: Yeah and I don't know. 
I: Do you think there's a difference between how you see yourself and how you think 
other people see you? 
L: No. 

I: You don't? 

L: No. 
I: So you maybe would have had similar images on both sides? 
L: Yeah. 

I: So it could have been one big collage? 

L: Yeah. 

I: And just finally, how do you describe your ethnicity? 
L: I normally go full detail about wh
at I'm half this or something. 
I: OK but what would you usually say? 

L: I'd usually say that, I'd go into a big story about it. 



 
344
I: You put English on your sheet. 
L: No I put Irish on the sheet. 

I: You ticked White Irish, but you put that you describe yourself as English. 
L: Yeah. 
I: Now if so me body asked you your ethnicity , would you usually just say I'm English? 

L: Yes I'd have to whether I just say the whole story without that I just say nah I say 
England. 
I: But do you see yourself as English? 

L: No. 
I: What do you see yourself as? 
L: Irish mainly. 

I: Irish mainly. 

L: Yeah. 

I: So why do you just say English? 
L: Well I think if you're Irish it's easier to
 say you're English 'cause you live in England 
so. 
I: So it's just easier for you? 

L: Yeah.

pictures and explain why you've chosen them, what they represent? 
M: I've used this goalie 'cause every sees me as a goalie and I'm good and this one 
[image of a goalkeeper attempting to save
 a shot] is another goalie because I'm good 
at saving penalties. That [image of Amir Khan] because I, I always fight. 
I: So you fight a lot? 

M: Not a lot but sometimes. 

I: So you see yourself as a fighter? 

M: Not really but I fight somet i mes. 
I: Do you think that's a good thing or a bad thing// 
M: //bad thing. 

I: Why is it a bad thing? (long pause) Why do you fight?

M: Because people pick on me. 
I: So you// 

M: //they try and bully me and think I won't do nothing.

re going to use some words to describe//

M: Don't know (laughing).

rent things. You've got the fighter and 
the violence, but you've also got that next 
to fishing and you said fishing is peaceful. 
Do you think you've got a calm side and an aggressive side as well? 
M: Mmm. 

I: OK let's move onto how you think other people see you. You've got a picture of a 
footballer there//

music on. 
I: So do you think that coul
d have all been one collage? 
M: Yeah. 

I: If you had more time are there any other pictures you would have put on?

hardcore singers. 
I: What makes something good for you though?

you've got to be quite hard-working// 
M: //yeah// 
I: //and determined, do you think that that's how you see yourself?

Robert,13,"I: You've done two separate collages yes? 
R: Yeah. 

I: Let's start with how you see yourself. 

R: I started the day just colouring some red area surrounded by some blue colouring. I 
think that shows that I bundle up loads of 
anger inside of me but I don't actually 
shout or use it or get angry. 
I: Right. 

R: I just got a PSP because most people probably see me like geeky and clever and stuff 
'cause I like computers and stuff like that. 
I: OK. 

R: I've got a Max Power Great White [car] 
which is, I think it shows that I can, well I 
like building stuff and ma king things, it s
hows that I can customise and think about 
things and can create new stuff. 
I: OK. 

R: I've got a Coke can because I think Coke 
is something that go round on their own. 
They don't go round, you can get single can or multi-pack can't you? 
I: Yes. 
R: And I think I'd just be like a single can just on my own and no-one else around me 
really. 



 
352
I: Right. 
R: I've got loads of business men in a bank,
 I think that shows, well it shows that I'm 
kind of like boring, it shows that I'm not interesting to most people. 
I: So you see yourself as boring// 
R: //y eah. I've got lights because mo stly inside I feel bubbly and happy but like that 
shows how it can change because it can just, it can't just be sticky all the time, it can 

change. 
I: So you've left it [the picture] part 
unstuck to the paper because although you feel 
bubbly it's not secure? 
R: Yeah. 
I: So if you were going to use some words to describe how you see yourself, what 
words would you use? 
R: Boring. 

I: Why do you see yourself as boring? 
R: Because I, people have fun in class and people talk about stuff, I just get on with my 
work. 
I: And do you think that's boring? 

R: Yeah. 

I: If you're talking about being in a classr
oom situation, do you think being boring then 
is a good thing or a bad thing? 
R: Well if you're not boring you can make frie
nds and have fun, if y ou don't you just get 
on with your work and that's it really. Nothing good comes out of just getting on 

with my work yet so.

politicians because that's a possible thi
ng that probably peopl
e, when I'm older 
people will probably see me as a kind of political person. 
I: Why would they see you as a political person? 

R: Because with the grey I'll co me out with
 some job where I wear a suit and stuff and 
they probably think I was a political person,
 interesting person just from the image. 
I: OK. 
R: The street planner and coordinator that's wh
at, it's really weird but I think that's what 
people think going on in my head, that's what people think. 
I: What do you mean street planner and coordinator going on in your head? 

R: It's like really busy stuff all the time, I think that's what people think. 
I: That there's a lot going on in your head? 
R: Yeah always a lot because now I'm mumb ling and it shows that I think about a lot of 
things. 
I: OK. 

R: That one [image of a politician] I don't know
 who, but it's just that one again, the 
politician guy. Chatterbox, I never shut up 
[images of mobile phones]. I get on with 
my work and stuff like that, I get on with my work and settle down but out of lesson 
time I just talk and talk and talk I don't shut up. 
I: OK. 

R: The area in London, Trafalgar Square? 

I: Piccadilly Circus. 
R: Yeah shows busy, really really busy. 
I: Your head is busy ? 

R: Yeah, just stuff going through it all the time. Can't stop thinking about anything. 



 
353
I: What don't you stop thinking about? 
R: Doing homework, work, school, everything. I just think about all the time for some 
reason. 
I: Is that a good thing or a bad thing// 
R: //bad thing. 

I: Why is it a bad thing? 

R: Because I can't just think about one thing, it just won't clear out of my head. 

I: So what do you want to be able to think about? 

R: I want to think about what I'm doing. 
 Sometimes I think about what I'm going to 
plan, so in D.T. [design an d technology ] I think about what plan I do, a 3D mod el of 
it in my head, then I think about one point of
 it then it just carries on continuously and 
it's just like my head hurts thinking about loads of other things. 
I: So do you worry a lot? 

R: Yeah. 
I: And do you think other people see you as a worrier? 
R: Yeah. 

I: And y ou think that's a negative? 

R: Yeah. 

I: Do you think that that could ever be a positive? 
R: No because I think about it all the time 
and most times I forget things as well. 
I: You forget things? 

R: I like, I think about it too much. 

I: So what about these two pictures here [i
mage of a newspaper and careers exhibition 
advertisement]? 
R: I'm very good at English, I like English, 
I like it a lot a lot so showed newspaper and 
just writing and stuff like that. 
I: Do other people see you as a writer? 

R: Yeah yeah. Jobs and careers and prospect
s that's the one thing that, my teacher has 
been going really on at me about thinking 
about my jobs and careers and stuffs and 
prospects and I think that other people see 
me as someone who really thinks about 
jobs, careers and prospects, about the future. 
I: So other people see you as// 

R: //what it is is every picture starting from 
the first collage and the second collage just 
shows I think a lot, in my head I'm always thinking about it. 
I: Do you think much about your future// 

R: //y eah y eah. 
I: In what sense? 
R: Well what I'm gonna be when I'm olde
r what I'm gonna do when I'm older. 
I: Do you worry about that? 

R: Someti mes. 

I: Why do you worry? 
R: Because, well I just worry about it, no reason, I just worry. 
I: Do you know what you want to do ? 

R: Yeah. 

I: What do you want to do? 

R: I want to be a lawyer. 

I: Why do you want to be a lawyer? 
R: It has really good pay and it's got loads of industries involved with to do with it. 
I: So what words would you use to descr
ibe how you think other people see you? 
R: A boffin. 

I: A boffin? 

R: Yeah. 
I: Do you think that there's a differen
ce between how you see yourself and how you 
think other people see you? 
R: Yeah. 



 
354
I: What's the difference? 
R: Because people don't see me, people can't see me think and I don't think they think I 
can be creative and stuff. 
I: So why don' t you think th
ey see that side of you? 
R: Because I don't show it really, I'm only always working and just mainly working all 
the time. 
I: Why don't you show it to other people? 

R: Because I haven' t had the chance. 

I: You haven't had the chance? 
R: It just doesn't get any chance, you can't r
eally see. I customise things in my head and 
I build things, that don't sound right. 
I: If you had more time are there any other 
pictures that you would have put on either 
side of the collage? 
R: No. 
I: And just finally, how would you usually describe your ethnicity? 
R: British. 

I: Do you always say British or do you say English? 

R: Well when I say what I really am I'm qua
rter English, an eighth Spanish, an eighth 
Ameri can and quarter Turkish Cypriot and a quarter Irish. 
I: OK so why do you say British? 
R: Because I'm in Britain and it's a quarter equals most other things. 

I: So you see yourself as British? 

R: Yeah I'm in Britain and it's a quarter of
 what makes up my identity along with other 
things. 
I: So it's easier for you to say you're British? 
R: Yeah. 
I: OK thank you. 

 

(C=Claire, aged 13, female; I=interviewer) 


I: Is this one big collage or is it two? 
C: Two. 

I: Let's start with ‚how I see myself' then. Do you just want to go through each of the 
pictures and explain what you're trying to express with them? 
C: I've always liked horse-ri
ding and stuff to do with horses and my cousin has got a 
horse and we go and see it and I just love hor
ses and next year I might be getting one. 
I: What is it about horses that you like? 
C: It's sort of my hobby really, I just en
joy like leading them and stuff because I haven't 
been that keen on riding but I've ridden twic
e before I went to a riding school but I've 
always liked looking after them. 
I: What about this picture of lots of magazines? 
C: Yeah every time I go shopping I have to
 buy a magazi ne especially the soap ones. 
I: What is it about the soap ones that you 
like? Why are soaps so important to you? 
C: I don't know really I just like soaps, I like watching them and seeing what's 
happening in them. 
I: What's your favourite soap? 

C: They all are, 
EastEnders
 would be probably but all of them really. 
I: Have you got a favourite character that you identify with? 
C: What I'm more really actually doing is I see the young like girls my age on the 
programmes and I'd like to be fashionable like them sort of thing. 
I: So y ou'd like to be fashionable. Do y ou think that y ou are fashionable? 

C: Some of my stuff is but not really. 
I: Not really? 
C: Yeah some of it is. 

I: Some of it. 



 
355
C: Yeah. 
I: What about th is little picture here, you've got R. Kelly? 

C: Oh yeah I love R. Kelly. 
I: What is it about R. Kelly that you like? 
C: His music rea lly. 

I: Is there anything about him as 
a person that y ou identify with? 
C: I don't know really. 

I: OK let's move onto the other side, on how you think other people see you, you've got 
a picture of some t-shirts. 
C: It's not like, my friends said to me I 
asked them how they see me and they said very 
fashionable and yeah just like wearing fashionable clothes really. 
I: So you think other people see yo u as fashionable, and although you've put 
fashionable on how you see yourself, you don't think that you maybe are as 

fashionable as// 
C: //other people// 
I: //other people see you. 

C: That's because I've got some nicer clot
hes in how other people see me but I see 
myself as a bit dull really. 
I: So you see yourself as a bit dull? 
C: Yeah. 
I: Why do you see yourself as a bit dull? 

C: I don't know really, because all my friends
, I don't know but, the reason is I don't 
really want to say it actually but, y eah. 
I: OK that' s fine. So if there wer e any mor e pictures you could add to these collages, 
what pictures would they be? 
C: Yeah. How other people see me I'd probably add a few to that. 
I: Like? 

C: More on quiet and caring and stuff. 

I: Do you think you're quiet and caring? 

C: Caring yeah. 
I: But not quiet? 
C: No. I'm more quieter at school than I am at home. 

I: So do you think you people see a differ ent side of who you are, and your family see a 
different side? 
C: Yeah I think. 

I: Do you wish you were not-so-quiet around other people? 
C: Not really I quite like being quiet really but, you know, and then I've got some pink 
here and I just love pink and with the clothes and things. 
I: So pink is your favourite colour? 

C: Yeah pink and lilac. 

I: Why do you like pink and lilac? 
C: That's what goes, I just like them really. 
I: And just finally how would you usually 
describe your ethnicity? (pause) You wrote 
British but do you always say British// 
C: //no English. 

I: You always say English? 

C: Yeah. 
I: Why do you choose English instead of British? 
C: It's probably because I'm used to Engla
nd because it's our country so that's why I 
just say English because I come from England. 
I: So it's English because you come from England? 

C: Yeah. 
I: OK that's excellent.

Alison,13,"I: OK Alison. Could you just go through the pictures and explain to me why you 
choose them and what you they represent? 
 So let' s start with ‚how I see myself' . 
A: Well I done a warning sign because sometimes when, when I'm at home and that and 
I'm just normal sometimes I can just break 
out and have a teenage rage at home so, 
and a flower because I like that kind of that flower stuff and that. 
I: What does the flower stuff mean to you though? 

A: It represents like pretty and 
stuff but I don't, I 
don' t think that I' m pretty so I kind of 
like that stuff but I'm not. 
I: So you like the prettiness but you don't see yourself as pretty? 

A: No. 

I: OK what about the monkey? 

A: Because I'm quite cheeky at home and I'm usually grounded and stuff so quite 
cheeky and that and then that Cancerian 
sign because that means quite a lot to me 
because like my nan' s Cancerian as well and she, she kind of knows all that kind of 

stuff but kind of means a lot to me, then a lion because sometimes I'm quite laree and 

shouting and stuff. I'm just a normal girl who's just normal, I'm not nothing special. 
I: Where's the normal girl? 
A: That one [image of Kelly Clarkson]. 
I: Is that Kelly Clarkson?

A: Yeah. 
I: Why is she a normal girl for you? 

A: I don't know she's just, she's just, well 
there's nothing special about her and there's 
nothing special about me either so. 
I: Ok let's move onto how you think other people see you. 
A: Yeah w ell I put a cat on there because I'm quite like loving and that, I put a heart as 
well to represent that. I put Max and Pa
ddy [comedy characters] because they're 
really funny// 
I: //who are they? 

A: Max and Paddy because I, because everyone says I'm quite funny and I'm a bit of a 
clown so. 
I: Do you think there's a difference between how you see yourself and how you think 
other people see you. 
A: Yeah. 

I: What's the difference? 

A: Well 'cause on the other side [how I s ee myself] I'm quite like, I show myself more 
and that, and when other people are around I'm not that, I'm not always open like 
that, not always talking and that. 
I: If you had more time are there any more pictures that you would have added? 

A: Just stuff that says that I'm intelligent so I would like put a pencil there. 

I: Do you see yourself as intelligent? 

A: Yeah. 
I: Do you think other people do? 
A: Yeah. 

I: And just finally how would y
ou usually describe y our ethnicity ?

(O=Oscar, aged 13, male; I=interviewer) 


I: Let's start with ‚how I see myself'. Do 
you just go through the pictures and explain 
what they are and why you've used them? 
O: Well I've got a mobile phone because I like to talk on my phone a lot, I've got 
somebody's big mouth because I don't ever shut up, I've got the Union Jack because 

I like love this country and I've got loads 
of like colourful flowers and stuff because 
like of the co lourful side and I've got the wrestling things because I'm really into 

wrestling and there's loads of sports things there because I like sport like football, 
baseball, swimming and that and there's a 
games console called PSP because I like to 
go on the PSP and Arnold Schwarzen eger he's got loads of muscles and I'm d oing 

weights and I want to get loads of muscles to. 
I: You've also got a picture of a girl th
ere [how I see myself], why did you do that? 
O: Because I fan cy her. 
I: Let's go to the picture of Arnold Schwarzenegger, is that how you see yourself? 
O: Well, well he's like my hero and that's how I see my self like in a few y ears. 

I: In a few years? 

O: Yeah that's what I see myself as. 

I: So do you think that's a good image, to want to be like? 
O: Yeah, yeah like quite muscley like Arnold Schwarzenegger yeah. 
I: Let's move onto how you think other peopl
e see you. You've only got a couple of 
pictures here, one of E.T. and one of My Little Pony, why have you used them? 
O: Because people, I think people might see me as an alien because sometimes I'm a bit 
weird or that's what other people think and 
I don't know, the little pony it's just pink, 
and people think I have a feminine side. 
I: Why do you think other people think you're weird? 
O: I don't know sometimes how I act really. 

I: Do you think you act weird? 

O: No. 

I: What about the feminine side, do you think you've got a feminine side? 
O: Well a little bit, but most of the time I 
just wanna laugh really and it's, and like try 
and make everybody laugh. 
I: Do you think other people see that, the feminine side, as a good thing or a bad thing? 

O: Well in-between. 

I: When might it be a good thing and when might it be a bad thing? 

O: Well, well like, like I said it might cheer people up because it's funny but like a bad 
thing, they might not want to 
be around me because like, like 
they just want to do that 
bully stuff all that stuff. 
I: Do you think there's a difference between how you see yourself and how you think 
other people see you? 
O: Well only a little bit. 
I: What is the little bit? 
O: Well like, well like lots of people know I'm 
really into the wrestling and the sport and 
the games consoles, but like not a lot of people think I've got a colourful side and like 

the two Union Jacks, like I love this country
 and stuff, but I don't think people see 
that, they just see me as like, from them pict
ures they just see me as a wrestling fan, a 
sports fan and a games console fan. 
I: Why do y ou think they don't see the colourful side of you? 
O: (long pause) I'm not quite sure. 

I: If you did show other people that you loved your country how would you do that? 

O: I don't know, I'd probably just like wear 
a Union Jack sign or wear a flag or have the 
song somewhere or something. 
I: Why don't you do that? 
O: Well I don't, I don't really see the point at
 the moment because I'm only like thirteen, 
maybe if it was a bit later on like maybe. 



 
359
I: If you could add on more pictures are there any more you would have added on? 
O: (long pause) Not any that I can think of, 
if I was like looking at
 a few pictures then I 
might see one and then I might think yeah I'
m kind of like that but like that's really 
all I could think of at the moment. 
I: And just finally, how would you usually describe your ethnicity? 

O: Yeah British white. 

I: Would you say British white or do you say English// 

O: //no English white. 

I: English white. Do you always say the white or do you just say English? 
O: I, I usually just say English. 
I: Just say English// 

O: //yeah English or British but mostly English. 

I: Why do you choose English over British? 

O: I, I don't really know it's kind of like if I'm chatting if I had to choose like London

se like the necklace with an ‚A' on it

I: OK let's start with ‚how I see myself'. Do you want to talk through the pictures 
you've used and why you've used them// 
L: //yeah. I've used these animals because I think I, well always with my friend and that 
so whatever happens, I've used Cheryl 
Tweedy who I think, I like her clothes and 
fashionable and that and I've used this
 PlayStation because I t hink that I'm like 
always playing games and in this picture [image of a cricket player] I see myself as a 

sporty sort of person always playing sport. In this picture with the girl smiling I think 

I'm always smiley// 
I: //who is that girl? 

L: She's from 
EastEnders
, Sonia's friend [Naomi]. A picture of a phone, I've used a 
phone because I'm always on the phone and alwa
ys ch atting and that and I've used a 
tele 'cause I'm always wat ching tele. 
I: So let's move onto how you think other people see you. Would you like to go 
through them pictures? 
L: Yeah I've used this lady ag ain because ot
her people might think that I'm quite sporty 
as well. 
I: OK so sporty is on both sides.

ally like watching DVD's and videos and that, 
I've used the bag because I always love
 to go shopping, I've used Peggy Mitchell

 worried in that picture and I'm always like 
worrying and I' ve used this girl, I don' t
 know who I can't remember who, because 
it's actually at a party and I love going to parties. 
I: So do you think that there's a differenc
e between how you see yourself and how you 
think other people see you? 
L: Not really, not really different. 

I: There's not? 
L: No. 
I: So if you had more time and you could 
add pictures, what pictures would you add? 
L: Well I'd probably get another one like that 
[image of a girl at a party] and put that 
over there [how I see myself]. I'm not sure what I would do. 
I: And just finally, how would you usually describe your ethnicity? 
L: English.

365
C: I've got a Kat Slater [
EastEnders
 character] because I'm always feeling confident in 
my self like she does, I've got Ronaldo and 
a couple of other footballers I look up to 
because I always see myself as inspirational trying to get my own goals and because I 
love football and just Chelsea because I'
ve always supported them daily. I've got 
Sean Wright-Phillips because I think that some
times I want to be like him 'cause he's 
done so much with his life, he got adopte
d and he doesn't really know his other dad 
and like I don' t see my dad often and he' s 
been with other people and I' m with 
someone now different like my mum and her 
boyfriend so I've been with quite a bit 
of people in my life. I've got Spectacular Pretty Ricky and 50 Cent 'cause I love his 
music and I love just phat rhythms music like rap and everything. 
I: Right. 

C: I don't know why I put Mario in this 'cause I've got his birthday, I'm on the same 
day as his birthday so I put him down, I've got Randy Orton 'cause I just love 

wrestling and I love, like not fighting and 
being a little scally or anything, love 
wrestling with my little sister like play-figh
ting 'cause we always see that and we get 
bored and sometimes just play-fight. But th
at's all the pictures I've got on there. 
And I put that DVD down 'cause I' m al ways watching DVD's. 
I: Right, you've put 50 Cent down on how you see yourself to represent that you like 
that ty pe of music// 
C: //yeah// 
I: //but do you think you share anything else with him, because 50 Cent has maybe got a 
bad reputation for being a bit of a gangster// 
C: //no I ain't like him. 

I: Is it just the music you like? 

C: Yeah. 
I: As a person do you think that you would id
entify with him [50 Cent] at all? Do you 
think you share any// 
C: //yeah he raps about his personal life and 
it's good so I do rap. I just sing about my 
personal stuff as him, so he sings about his stuff and I sing about my stuff and I think 

I'm like him sometimes, 
like speaking about his personal stuff in life. 
I: So do you think that's a good thing that rap does that// 
C: //yeah they should show them things 
because otherwise they get across the wrong 
way and they're not what they're made out to be like portray ed in the public. 
I: What about how you think other people see you? You've just used a picture of a 
phone// 
C: //yeah 'cause as soon as I get out of schoo
l as I'm walking home with my friends I'm 
always on the phone like my mum rings me, my dad texts me, my little sister texts 
me, friends in London text me, so I'm alway s texting. 
I: Do you think there's a difference though between how you see yourself and how you 
think other people see you? 
C: Kind of, I don't think people see me as confident all the time. 
I: But you think you are// 
C: //yeah, I am. I always do a lot of things on my own at home. 

I: Like? 

C: I don't think other people see me as 
like feeling a bit stronger, like I am, I've 
overcome a lot in my life like moving house and loads like that. 
I: And if you could have added anymore pict
ures to th at collage, what pictures would 
you have added? 
C: I would have had a phone over there [how I see myself] because I know I'm always 
on my phone and I'm using up my credit, ove
r there [how I think other people see 
me] I think I would have put someone that
 speaks out a lot 'cause I'm alw ays doing 
that 'cause I like chatting and I'm alw ays cha
tting get told off for chatting. I think I'd 
put on some kind of like, something stupid stuff 'cause sometimes it just comes out 
and I think it sounds right. And I don't know what else other people think of me 

'cause I don't really care what they think 
about me, it's what I think about myself. 



 
366
I: So you don't care about other peoples opinions, you just care about yourself? 
C: Yeah. 

I: Is that everybody else? 
C: I care about what my mum says what my fa
mily says and like my closest best mate 
which is only one, I've known her like eleven 
years I take in what she says. But not 
like all like, if those said I don't think you're strong, I would like I don't think I'm 

strong just think I'm confident and feeling a bit better about whatever you say, just 

goes in one ear and out the other as my mum says to me. 
I: And just finally, how would you usually describe your ethnicity// 
C: //English. 
I: Do you always say English? 

C: Yeah. 

I: Do you ever say British? 

C: Sometime s if I'm over in like on a tea m they have a hotel they say we're fro m 
Auckland 'cause that's all around the world, I say I'm from England but I don't tend 
to say I' m English I tend to say I' m British. 
I: Why? 

C: I don't know they're the exact same real
l y, someti mes I only use English someti mes I 
only use British. 
I: Do you think they are the same thing? 
C: Someti mes. 

I: When aren't they? 

C: I don't know. 

I: You don't know. 

C: No. I think I've always thought like sa
y ing 'cause English and British, British is all 
around the country and so is English 'cause Eng
lish is in many parts of the world, and 
you can't really say that sometimes can I 
'cause loads of people speak English and 
they're not from England so I can just
 say I'm British '
cause I'm United Kingdom 
I'm from there. 
I: OK brilliant.

u identify with that? Why do you see yourself 
as a boxer? 
C: I don't know, I just like it.

C: Yeah and I do it with Golden Ring in Shirley [boxing club]. 

I: OK let's go onto how you think other peopl
e see you, you've got a picture of Hitler 
and a picture of a cartoon. Why have you used a picture of Hitler?

people for no reason basically. 
I: He hit people for no reason? 



 
367
C: Yeah. 
I: So why does Hitler represent that for you? 

C: 'Cause he killed loads of people 
and I hit loads of people basically. 
I: Do you think that's a good thing or a bad thing// 
C: //bad. 

I: So do you think other people see 
y ou as a good person or a bad person? 
C: Sometimes good sometimes bad. 

I: When would they see you as bad? 

C: When I hit someone. 
I: Do you think that's good or bad? 
C: Bad. 

I: But you still do it? 

C: Yeah. 

I: Do you think there's a difference between how you think other people see you and 
how you see yourself? 
C: Yeah. 

I: What's the difference? 

C: I think I'm average. 

I: You think you' re average?

I: Do you think other people think that you are average? 

C: No. 

I: What do they think? 

C: Small.

C: Yeah. 
I: So they think you're small 
and yo u think yo u're average? 
C: Yeah, I'm average. 

I: If you had more time are there any other pictures that you would have put on? 

C: Like a, a little bit of a paper boy, I'd have put that on there to say that I was a good 
paper boy. 
I: And just finally, how would you usually describe your ethnicity? 

C: British. 

I: Would you say British or English? 

C: Depends where I am. 

I: Can you explain that? 
C: Yeah if I was like in Spain I would say I'm British but if I'm over here I'm English. 
I: Why would you say British in Spain and English over here? 

C: 'Cause my mum says I'm part Irish and Britis

different because the Gorillaz mu sic is a little bit different, quite mouthy? 
A: Yeah. 
I: What about how you th ink other people see yo u? 
A: I don't know. I like wrestling and fighting. 

I: But do you think other people see you as a fighter? Do you think that's a good thing 
or a bad thing? 
A: It's good and bad, but I think it's a bit of a bad thing. 

I: Why do you think it's a bit of a bad thing? 
A: 'Cause it's like if someone is annoying you, you could just say stop it but I would just 
turn round and punch them and that's a bad thing. 
I: When would that be a good thing though? 

A: If someone is like pushing you trying to beat you up. 

I: So if they are bullying you//

pictures that you would have liked to put

I: What is it about wrestling that you like? 

A: I don't know it's quite funny. 

I: It's quite funny? 

A: Yeah. 

I: But fighting is a bad thing, but do you think the wrestlers are bad for fighting? 
A: No not really. 
I: Are there any wrestling characters that you really like?

music that expresses who you are?

able to say that's how I see myself? 
A: But not Portuguese. 

I: But not Portuguese. So it's impor
tant for you to hold onto the English// 
A: //yeah, I'm English at heart. 
I: Do you feel more English, more Irish or both? 

A: I'm a bit of English and Irish, I live in England but my name is Irish.

I: But what is it about him [Eminem], apart from his music, do you think there's 
any thing about his personality that you share? 
D: No because he's quite rude actually. 

I: So he's quite rude, but you also look up to him? 

D: Yeah. 

I: Do you like him because he's rude? 

D: No but that's the whole point of rap and 
I'm rude sometimes but I don't like to be and 
try not to be. 
I: Do you like rap mu sic? 

D: It's OK. It's not my favourite kind of music. 

I: What's your favourite kind? 

D: Kelly Clarkson, pop music. 
I: You said that you think rap music a
nd Eminem is rude, and you can be rude 
sometimes, do you think that's a good thing or a bad thing? 
D: Quite bad actually, I try not to be rude and that. 

I: Quite bad? 

D: Yeah. 

I: In what way? 
D: Swearing and stuff. 
I: Is there anything good about rap music and Eminem that you identify with? 

D: It speaks about life and Eminem is main ly speaking about his experiences. 

I: So that's a good thing? 

D: Yeah, because it's telling people about what
 he's been through and that's what I try 
and do. 
I: Let's move on. You've got this picture 
here of a cartoon guy with funny hair. What 
does that mean? 
D: He's off this programme called 
Dragonball
. 



 
371
I: Called? 
D: 
Dragonball
. 
I: So why did you use the picture of him there? 
D: Because I like him because he's a good guy. 
I: He's a good guy? 

D: Yeah he's extremely strong and fights off all the bad guys. 

I: In what way is he a good guy ? 

D: Because he fights off all the bad guys. 

I: He fights off all the bad guys. Now I've noticed that you didn't do a collage here on 
this side, how you think other people see you, why is that? 
D: Because I think it's you know, both. 

I: So you think how you see yourself is how you think other people see you? 

D: Yeah. 

I: If you had more time are there any othe
r pictures y ou would have added to y our 
collage? 
D: No. 

I: And just finally, how would you usually describe your ethnicity? 

D: English.

Do you just want to go through each of the 
images and explain what they mean? 
S: The first one is my religion [image of Ar
abic text] which is, it's got my god's name 
on which means I' m Muslim and that' s the 
most important thing my religion. And 
the next picture [image of a water melon] is my favourite food, a water melon because 
I really like it and then it's my favour
ite artists [images of Beyonce, Lemar and 
Mario] I've got loads. 
I: Who are they? 

S: Beyonce, Lemar and Mario. 

I: What is it about them [images of Beyonce, Lemar and Mario] that you identify with? 
S: I like their character, they're very confident and they've tried very hard to get to this 
point so I think yeah they've tried best very hard in life to get this yeah, and I just 

think that she's [Beyonce] very pretty and yeah. 
I: And so her [Beyonce] prettiness, do you th
ink that's something you share with her? 
S: Well I do have some self-confidence; I do think I'm a bit pretty but not that much. 
I: So not as pretty as Beyonce? 
S: No. Well the second pictures I've got 
Burberry, Estee Lauder, Chanel and Dior 
which I'm a fashion mark, so I'm really fash
ionable and I buy like this kind of stuff. 
I like make-up and stuff and I like to be fashionable and be myself and that's why I 

put some mar ks, fashion marks on there. 
I: Are designer labels important to you? 
Is the name of a product important to you? 
S: Well it depends; it depends if it's good or
 not because someti mes you can just buy 
cheap ones. 
I: As in? 

S: You know just cheap fashion marks but// 

I: //what is cheap fashion to you? 
S: I don't know, if you buy from Primark 
and stuff but everybody shops from Primark 
like, but anyway I just like them [d esigner brands] because that's what I am about, 

yeah. 



 
372
I: So it's just purely for the name? 
S: Yeah. I'm planning to be a fashion designer and that's why I like them. 

I: OK, let's move onto how you think other people see you. 
S: Other people see me they probably think 
if I'm wearing fashionable clothes they 
think I'm fashionable and I'm happy because 
I'm always smiling and, I don't know if 
they think I'm too pretty or not, I'm not to sure about if they see I've got to much 

self-confidence that I do seem nice. 
I: What is it about you that you think they will see// 

S: //personality. 
I: So y our personality reflects, it shows y our self-confidence? 
S: Yeah. Well I'm very muc h a acce ssorie s and stuff so I'm very blingy . 

I: Bling? 

S: Yeah. 

I: What is being bling? 
S: It' s where like, me being, me picturing stuff you know like accessories, bling. 
I: Is there a way you have to behave
 to be bling or is it just a look? 
S: I don't know, I think it's just a look. 

I: Who is this person here? 

S: That's a girl from the Pussycat Dolls [Melody Thornton]. 
I: And why is she there? 
S: I don't like her but I just pu t her there 
because she's got this like self-confidence and I 
think people see me as I've got some self-confidence really. 
I: Now I've noticed on your collage that the 
two sides are a ctually quite similar, apart 
from the fact that you've used religion on how you see yourself// 
S: //yeah but people, because sometimes when
 people ask me what my religion is and 
when I say Muslim and they like wow I didn't expect you to be a Muslim because I 
don't look like it, and that's why I don't think people see me as a Muslim. 
I: What do you think people expect you to look like if you say you are a Muslim? 

S: I would not put so much make-up on and, I don't know, just the scarf thingies that 
they put on. 
I: So is that a positive or a negative view of Muslims? 
S: No, that's not negative, I wouldn't say it'
s a negative but they expect you to wear 
long tops and you know// 
I: Burkha? 

S: Yeah and all that stuff, but my parents 
and everything my family says when I'm ready 
to wear it like that headscarf stuff I can wear it. 
I: And would you? 
S: Yeah. 

I: Right. How would you usually describe y our ethnicity? 

S: Well I'm Swedish but my mum and dad are from// 

I: //you were born in Sweden? 
S: Yes, and my mum and dad are from Iraq, so that's kind of like different. 
I: OK. 

S: I lived in Sweden my whole life and then moved to England, but my parents have 
lived in like their childhood they spent it in Iraq so I don't know what I am really. 
I: Do you think you identify with them being from Iraq at all? 

S: Yeah well it's like my nationality it's wh
ere my parents and my family come from. 
I: But you've written down Swedish? 
S: Yeah. I know, I just wrote down my parents are Iraqis the other side because I don't 
know really if I'm essentially Swedish or Iraqi
 but I just wrote Swedish because that's 
where I was born. 
I: So y ou're not sure? 
S: No. 
I: What makes it so confusing? 



 
373
S: I don't know really. It's just that some people say if you're born in a country you 
co me fro m it and some other people say wherever y our parents come fro m y ou co me 

from that country to, and I don't know if I'm both or just one. 
I: What do you think you are though?

May,13,"I: Do you want to just talk through each of the images and explain what they mean and 
why you've used them? 
M: I like dogs they're my favourite well my favourite pet's to have so I put that there and 
I just thought they were really cute so I put
 them over, there and I want to be a marine 
biologist so I'm interested in like water lif
e. Manatees are my favourite animal so I 
swam with them when I went to Florida 
two weeks ago so I like them. I'd like a 
swimming pool in my house. 
I: Why have you used a picture of an otter? 

M: Because they' re really cute, it' s a bit like my dog. 

I: And yo u've also got some penguins? 
M: Yeah, they're cute. 
I: You've said that you're very animal orientated, but what is it about nature and 
animals that you specifically like? 
M: I wouldn't say I'm really into nature it'
s just the animals. I don't know how to 
explain. 
I: Do you think any of these animals have characteristics or qualities that you share? 
M: I think dogs are quite, they know, they are very aware. 
I: Do you see yourself as a person who is quite aware and alert to what' s going on? 

M: Not really no. 

I: No? 

M: No. 
I: Is there any thing about these animals that you think you share? 
M: I think dolphins and manatees are very like, 
they give lots of love, they love their 
families and th ey have special ways to greet
 their families and stuff and I'm similar, 
you know. 
I: So you've got symbols here that represent calm and peaceful here but you've not 
used, as opposed to the other people's 
collages, images of famous people. 
M: Oh no I wouldn't no, I'm not keen on celebrities a lot of the time. 
I: Which celebrities would you have put though// 

M: //I would have put Mariah Care
y because I think she's really good. 
I: What is it about Mariah Carey// 

M: I think she's really pretty and confiden
t and I don't know if she's been around a long 
time she's kind of I don't know. 
I: Do you think that you're pretty and confident as well? Do you think you share that? 

M: Not really, I don't know, I'm not like I'm 
not very confident really and I'm like a bit 
shy. 
I: So when you look at Mariah Carey is that somebody you aspire to be like? 

M: Not really I just like her music and everything; I don't really like to be like her or 
anything. 
I: Is there anyone else? 

M: I like Pussycat Dolls and Kanye West; I like all sorts of musi c. 

I: Now on this side, how you think other pe
ople see you, you've not put any pictures. Is 
that because of time? 
M: Yeah. 
I: If you had more time do you think that that
 collage would be different to how you see 
yourself? 



 
374
M: Yeah because I don't really share like anyt
hing with people I just keep like that, I like 
well I share it with my family but I don't r
eally say that I'm interested in like marine 
biology and stuff because I' m just usually quite
 quiet about th at and then they [other 
people] probably see me as like just kind and so I like shopping so they probably 
think I'm very keen on shopping. 
I: So they wouldn't see// 

M: //they wouldn't see me as, I don't think th
ey'd see me like that [how I see myself] and 
my best friend would but I don't think other people would. 
I: And just finally, how would you usually describe your ethnicity? 
M: I'm English and British. 
I: Which one would you usually say? 

M: English. 

I: Why would you usually say English and not British? 

M: Because I'm not like, both of my parents are from England but my mum's parents are 
kind of from Poland and apart from that my da
d and everyone in the family is English 
so I just want to put English because I don
' t really, I don't really class myself as 
Polish because I'm not really Polish I was born over here. 
I: OK that's brilliant. 

 
(L=Linda, aged 13, female; I=interviewer) 


I: This is quite unusual. Do
 you want to just talk throu
gh what you are trying to express 
with this collage? 
L: Inside I tried to put kind of dark colours 
like red like anger, hatred and I kind of hide 
those feelings, and I arranged those colours 
I put colours blue and yellow and orange 
to show happy on the edge. 
I: So the colours are symbolising your different moods and you always try and contain 
your anger and hatred? 
L: Yeah I'm not, I'm not really an angry pers
on but when I've got, whenever I do I just 
get annoyed and I don't get angry. My best
 friend she gets angry very easily and she 
always does something about it, but like when I get angry I just kind of lock it in 
myself or like draw pictures or hide it because I don't like people knowing that I can 

get quite angry sometimes. 
I: So you always keep it bottled up. 

L: Yeah. 

I: Do you think anger is a negative or a positive emotion? 
L: Negative. 
I: Is it always negative? 

L: It's a, I like to see myself as a kind of conscious person that's why I try not to let any 
people see it. 
I: OK. You've used a picture of a cat, wh
ich is one of the few images that you have 
used, and you've also used the words ‚dream', ‚think' and ‚time'. Do you want to 
explain why you used those? 
L: Well the cat, I have a cat and it's, he's
 always like a good listener even though he 
doesn't answer or anything but he's also qu
ite kind of free so I think that's how I'd 
more like to be, kind of not like any boundaries keeping me. 
I: Do you think you're a good listener? 
L: Sometimes. 
I: When aren't you a good listener? 

L: Probably if I've had a situation before
 which went badly, so if I've had a big 
argument and then I'd be kind of not really focused. 
I: Now you've only done one collage, how you see yourself, do you think that how you 
think other people see you would be the same? 



 
375
L: Well I kind of mixed it into this one because the happy and calm and like cheerful 
turns round the darker colours and it would be what other people see me from the 

outside but not the inside. 
I: Do people ever see the inside? 
L: Sometimes, like I know my best friend Holly does. 

I: But on the whole people don't? 

L: No. 

I: If you had more time, how would you ha
ve developed this picture further? 
L: I think I'd try and get slightly more 
candid pictures, so kind of represent that 
sometimes I'm really confused. 
I: Confused over? 

L: Anything, it can be anything. 

I: Anything? 

L: Yeah, like maybe when I'm trying to do my work. 
I: Do you know what images you would use? 
L: No, but if I saw them I'd probably know. 

I: OK. How would you usually describe your ethnicity? 

L: English or British, if me and a group 
of friends had been like talking about old 
England or something we'd describe British 
kind of in a dramatic way or something 
but if people ask me then just English. 
I: What do you mean by old England? 

L: Say in the Victorian times they used to
 be all posh and so you do usually say British 
in like a posh accent. 
I: So do you think saying British is trying to be posh? 

L: No, it's kind of like a doing it to my fri
ends in an old Englis
h accent then if a new 
person would say I'm from here I would just say I'm British, English sorry. 
I: So you would say English? 

L: Yeah. 

I: OK, thanks.

trying to represent with the pictures? 
C: That one [i mage of a man jumping] I'm qu
ite active and I like sport so I put that one 
because I think that represents that. I lik
e having fun and I put ‚Septe mber' [word] 
because that was the month that my birthday's in and ‚mood' [word] I'm not sure 
why I put that one down and for this one [cartoon image of a woman in bikini] I put 

the beach because I like the su
mmer and going to the beach.

C: //because that's where I come from. 
I: And chocolates? 
C: My favourite. 

I: OK, we'll move onto how 
you think other people see you. It's less busy than the 
other side, you've just got the words ‚shy', ‚creativity' and an image of a cartoon 

drawing. 
C: I think my parents see me as someone like that because like I have an attitude. 
I: In a good way or a bad way? 
C: Like at home when I'm like arguing like with my parents they think that I have an 
attitude, so like a teenager with their hands 
on their hips. And put shy because lots of 
people think I'm shy and people think I'm quite creative a person. 
I: Do you think there's a difference between how you see yourself and how you think 
other people see you? 
C: I'm not sure, I think so. 

I: In what way? 



 
376

I: I've also noticed that you've not used 
any pictures of famous people. If you had 
more time, are there any extra pictures that you would have put on? 
C: I don't know. I don't know which ones I 
would have found. So I would have put on 
more pictures if I had more time but I don't know what ones. 
I: You don't know which ones? 

C: No. I was just like looking through and anything that caught my eye. 

I: And just finally, I asked you how you would usually describe your ethnicity. What 
would you usually say? 
C: That I'm British. 
I: Do you always say that you're British, because some people say English? 

C: Yeah, I'd say English. 

I: You'd say English? 

C: Yeah. 
I: Which one? 
C: I'd probably say that I'm English because that's the language. 

I: Because that's the language? 

C: Mmm. 

I: I don't really say British but I'd say English. 
I: So you think that British and English are the same thing? 
C: Yeah. 

I: But then why would you usually say English?

In: Is this one big collage? 
I: Yeah. 
In: I've noticed a picture of Trinny
 and Susannah, why are they there? 
I: Becaus e my friends and myself are a bit like them and we want to be like interior 
fashion designers when we're ol
der so they're like our idols. 
In: Your idols. So do you think that they are positive role models? 
I: Yeah. 
In: What is it about them that you like and identify with? 

I: They're like honest about you know people, what they think people look like and how 
they can be improved. 
In: Do you want to go through each of
 the pictures and what it means? 
I: I love animals basically and I like to 
give money to the RSPCA because a lot of 
animals that people just leave, you know don't treat right, so that's why I've put 
them. I like her [image of Catherine Tate] she's so funny. 
In: Do you know her name? 

I: Yeah Catherine Tate I think it is. 
 ‚3' [number] is my lucky number. 
In: What about this picture of Fearne and Reggie [television presenters]? 
I: I love Reggie and I think they look nice together. 
In: What about this picture of a baby, what does that mean? 

I: I adore little babies and because I've got several sisters, younger ones, I like having 
them close but yeah, I haven't seen them for ages so.

I: Because I draw Manga I' ve got a book full of different character s that I like to draw 
dedicated like a couple of months at the moment to it, then I'm writing about a story

I: So what are you trying to express about how you see yourself? 

In: I don't want to sound big-headed but I'm talented. 

In: Talented in what way? 
I: Well I can sing, I can draw, I can play the 
piano and I've got quite a few friends that 
think the sa me as well. 
In: Now you've only done one collage. Do you think how you see yourself is how you 
think other people see you? Do you think there is a difference between the two? 
I: If there is a difference it would be quite slight I think. 

In: Where would the difference be? 
I: Not with what I can do but my personality. 
In: But what part of y our personality would they see different? 

I: Well my friends would see me as quite a funn
y like sort of person, but then the people 
that I don't get on with would think like 
differently, and then normal people would 
think that I'm quite shy and all that like 
you know if I was walking down the street 
because I'm like in my own little world, but 
then with my friends I'm different so.

In: Why would you use English? 

I: Because I'm not connected to that the Trinadian part of my family if you know what I 
mean, because I've never actually met my grand-dad.

and I've never actually met him, and so I'm

Polly,13,"I: Is this two separate collages or one collage? 
P: One collage. 
I: Do you want to just talk about what pictures you' ve used and why? 

P: I used words ‚I am what I am' because I am what I am basically. 

I: And what are you? 

P: Annoying I think. 

I: Annoying? 
P: Yeah. 
I: In what way? 

P: Like loud and stuff like that. 

I: OK and who are these pict ures of? 

P: I like people and Arsenal and people see me as cute so I put this picture [image of a 
baby]. 
I: Who is this a picture of? 

P: Thierry Henry. 

I: Is it just because you like Ar
senal that you've used him? 
P: No, I like him as well. 
I: In what way? 
P: In another way. 

I: And who is this [image of Melody Thornton from the Pussy cat Dolls]?

I: She looks quiet but she's not? 
P: Yeah. 

I: Do you think that's a good thing or a bad thing? 

P: That's a good thing. 

I: Why? 
P: Because you need to be loud. 
I: Why would you need to be loud? 

P: So people can hear you, shows like you're confident and stuff. 

I: Show that y ou're confident? 

P: Yeah. 

I: And when would it be good to be quiet? 
P: When you're in a test and stuff like when you have to be quiet otherwise you'd get 
your paper ripped up. 
I: OK and what are them pictures on that 
side [how I think ot
her people see me]? 
P: Because some people think I'm a brat 
so I put ‚brat attack' [words] and I like 
basketball because I play basketball. 
I: Do you think you are a brat? 
P: Yeah. 

I: Do you think that being a brat is a good thing or a bad thing? 

P: No, no actually I don't think I'm a brat but people say I am so. 

I: Why do you think people think you are a brat? 

P: Because they say I'm spoilt but I'm not. 
I: Why would they say that you're spoilt? 
P: Because they say I have every thing but I don't.

I write. 
I: You write black British? 
P: Yeah. 

I: Would you ever just write British? 

P: Yeah but (pause), I'm not exactly white so. 

I: So do you think being British means, do you think that if y ou just wrote British 
people would think that you were white? 
P: No they could think that you were Asian or something. 

I: They could think you were Asian? 

P: No, no they could think you were Asian or black or mixed race.

(C=Carly, aged 14, female; I=interviewer) 

I: Carly, you've done two separate collages? 

C: Yeah yeah. 

I: Do you want to start with how you see yourself and just explain what pictures you've 
used and why you've used them? 
C: I've used the UK flag beca
use that's where I was born here and I just wanted to show 
that. I showed the target because I' m, I like to
 be ambitious and I like to hit my target 
basically so in school or anything and I did the mountain with a person on top 

because I'm ambitious and, yeah so I just wa
nted to show that. I wrote well had the 
word ‚heaven' with a question mark next 
to it because I'm not really sure what I 
believe in, heaven or not, and I just wanted to show that, and I showed the picture of 
the confused person because I'm confused w
ith my friends with their sexuality and 
stuff like that I just wanted to show so// 
I: //you're sorry? 

C: My friends and like their sexuality like, how do I explain it, because they're like 
always coming to me because I feel like I'm like the advice person and with friends 
they come to me with their problems. 
I: In what way are they confused about their sexuality? 

C: Well I've got a friend and she doesn't know 
if she's like in-between if you understand 
what I mean (laughter). 
I: Do you mean she doesn't know if she's lesbian or// 

C: //yeah yeah and she's always talking to 
me about it because she's confused so I put 
the confused face because I' m the agony aunt of the group. 
I: Now what about the word ‚race' and this
 image here [image of African children]? 
C: I put that because my dad is African and my
 mum is English and I wanted to put that 
I belong to both groups, like I'm African 
and English at the same time y eah so I 
wanted to put a picture of that there. 
I: OK let's move onto how you think other people see you. 
C: I put the angry face beca use I think pe
ople can see I'm quite bossy and get quite 
stressed so me times. I put the sun because I think that so me people see me a s a h appy 

person. 
I: What about ‚I'll speak out' [words]? 

C: Because I'm quite opinionated and I say my views, I put my views out straight away. 
And I put the power button because I think people see me as quite tuned in to a, if 
you're talking about an issue I get quite tuned into it and put my views across. 
I: Do you think that both sides of the collage are the same? Do you think how you think 
other people see y ou is the sa me as how y ou see y ourself? 
C: Slightly , in one way the whole ambitious thing is one but in another way I think, 
happy side I think I'm quite a happy person 
like I think that's how other people see 
me. 
I: So y ou do think they are the sa me? 



 
384
C: Yeah I do actually yeah. 
I: Yes? 

C: Yeah. 
I: I've just noticed a picture of Pete Doherty on how you see yourself, what does that 
mean? 
C: It was just like the cigarette because I don'
t like smoking or anything like that so I did 
it with a cross through it. 
I: So if you had mo re time are there a
ny pictures that you would have added to the 
collage? 
C: What to any side? 
I: Didn't you just say how you think ot
her people see you is how you see yourself? 
C: Yeah I would have, I would have put more of
 the same pictures on either side because 
I think they're quite different. 
I: What is the biggest difference do you think between both sides? 
C: I haven't put my sort of emotions on this side [how I see myself] I put what I see 
people think of me, how emotionalised on this side [how I think other people see me] 

but none on this side I just put what I'm into 
really and, yeah that's what I've really 
put if that makes sense. 
I: So you would have put more emotions on how I see myself? 
C: Yeah yeah. 
I: You would have may be have used the same images for both sides or done one big 
collage? 
C: Yeah I could have done one big collage actually because I think they're quite the 
same so. 
I: And just finally, how would you usually describe your ethnicity? 
C: British because that's where I was born but I sometimes I say I'm mixed race as well. 
I: What one do you usually say? 

C: English. 

I: English or British? 

C: British or English really, more British. 
I: Why more British? 
C: I probably say that because I'm more part of, I don't know the, I don't know how to 
describe it, more part of the UK just, I don't know. 
I: What do you mean by more part of the UK? 

C: I just think of, like UK is a whole big country so I just say yeah I'm British like that 
because I' m yeah, well I do say I'm English but I'm more British.

animals.

y person, who is quite peaceful and cal m

out and I like to stand out. I'm lik e

sometimes annoyed and I'm not sure why I put them but I just like them so I (long

I: Do you think that there's a difference 
then between how you think other people see 
you and how you see yourself, because this one [how I think other people see me] 

seems to focus on emotions a lot more than
 this side [how I see myself]? (long pause) 
Like here [how I think other people see me
] you've put that you stand out and other 
people might think that you're angry or sad, so is there a difference between these 

two sides? 
R: A little bit of a difference because of di
fferent like emotions on either sides. 
I: What are the differences with the emotions? Like on this side [how I see myself] 
you've put that you're happy but you've not
 done this on the other side. So do you 
think other people don't see you as happy? 
R: Sometimes they do sometimes they don't, because sometimes I'm really stressed out 
and sometimes I' m not so. 
I: So what emotions would be in how you see yourself that other people would rarely 
see?

like to be different, I don' t like to be like

d mask on her face. I've noticed Green Day//

I: So let's start with ‚how I s ee myself'. Do
 you want to go through each of the pictures 
and explain why you've used them, what you are trying to express, what they 
represent? Let's start up here with this flag. 
J: OK I'm like half English and half Jamai
can, it's like my mum is English and I was 
born here so that shows that and my dad's Jamaican so just put like what I am. 
I: So the mixture of two sides as one? 
J: Yeah. 
I: And then you've got these trainers and the b
asketball player and is that a sports logo? 
J: Yeah. 

I: What do they represent? 

J: Well I like sport a lot, just saying that I like it a lot really. 

I: Right and what is it about sport that you like? 
J: Um like the competition and the physical side of it. 
I: So you like the competition? 

J: Yeah. 

I: Is that because, is it more the taking part or is it about the winning for you? 

J: It's good; I like it if I win. 
I: OK and what about these pictures here because you've got, what is that an ipod? 
J: Yeah. 

I: What does that represent? 

J: Like that I like music and the 50 Cent logo like the favourite like singer person I like, 
like look up to you know. 
I: What is it about 50 Cent that you like? What is it about him or his music that you 
identify with? 
J: It's just like good music and it like tells stuff but like, in like rap kind of thing. 

I: What sort of stuff? What do you mean? 

J: Like in different places, like towns an
d stuff like d ifferent people and like kind of 
telling other stories, like telling his 
own and other people's stories. 
I: So he's telling his life story and other people's? 
J: Yeah yeah. 

I: And why do you like that? 

J: I don't know I just think its good how like he expresses himself and it makes you 
think about different places a
nd different people and stuff. 
I: Because the thing is, 50 Cent also has quite a bad reputation// 
J: //yeah// 

I: //because he acts at times like a bit of a gangster type// 

J: //yeah. 

I: So do you think that people like 50 Ce
nt are positive or negative role models? 
J: I think they're like kind of in the middle, like people are. 
I: In what way// 
J: //like shooting and stuff, obviously that's 
wrong but like, he's like, made his way up 
kind of thing to be like singi
ng and famous and stuff like 
that and achieved something 
with his life. 
I: So he's both at the same time? 
J: Yeah. 
I: And what about, you'v e got a picture of boobs there, what does that represent? 

J: I just thought I'd be pretty funny, I put it on.

I: How do you feel about your school? Do you enjoy it here? 
J: Yeah, it's OK. 

I: In what way is it part of how you see yourself? 

J: It's just generally like what I do most of the time, I go to school. That's what I do I 
might as well put it in there. 
I: OK and let's move on to how I think other 
people see me. You've got a trainer again, 
well it's the same trainer just a different colour// 
J: //yeah// 

I: //does that represent sport again? 

J: Yeah. 

I: You've also got a gun and// 
J: //it's like a diamond thing// 
I: //a diamond and graffiti. What do they mean? 

J: Like gangster stuff, it's like a lot of bl
ack people are gangsters and stuff and they like 
do drugs and stuff like that. 
I: And you've got the picture of a gangster here? 
J: Yeah. 
I: Do you think other people see you as a gangster? 

J: Like their first reaction is like, because 
of my colour they could think like that. 
I: Why do you think that they would think that though? 

J: I don't know. 

I: Where would they get them ideas from? 
 Where would they get the idea that black 
people are all gangsters? 
J: 'Cause like a lot of like you see on TV or in 
like films and stuff like that, a lot of like 
the black people are more gangster types. 
I: What type of other people do you think woul
d think of you, or could think of you that 
way if they saw you? 
J: Just like random people, I don't know. 
I: Is that something you're aware of on a 
daily basis, that when people se e y ou they 
might// 
J: //yeah. They could like, if they're thinki
ng of it like, they could think loads of 
different things and that's like the first thing I came up with. 
I: So there's a massive difference betw
een how you think other people see y ou// 
J: //mmm// 
I: //and how you see yourself? 

J: Yeah. 

I: Going back to this side [how you think other people see you]. Are you very 
conscious of your, like y ou said that th e media build up the image of black people as 
gangsters// 
J: //yeah// 

I: //do you think that that's getting better, that they are moving away from it? That 
there are more positive images of black peopl
e, or do you think that it's still quite bad 
and black people are still shown in a negative way? 
J: They are still shown, it's still a little bit. 
I: Can you give me so me examples? 
J: U m. 

I: Any films or programmes or music or anything where you think// 

J: //like rap music and stuff like that like pe
ople show like black people shooting people 
or on like X-Box games if its, like on 
Grand Theft Auto
 where you go and shoot 
people it's a black person it's not a white pe
rson, it's like the black people who do the 
shooting kind of thing. 
I: For you then, in the media are 
there any positive black role models? 



 
389
J: Yeah there is some, I don't know his name, it's Ladley King or something, I don't 
know his name. 
I: Who is he? 
J: He like spoke up about like the black pe
ople's needs and stuff like that; like they 
should be equal and stuff like that. 
I: Oh, Martin Luther King. 

J: That's it, yeah. 

I: How do you think that this side [how 
I think other people see me] will change so 
people don't think of black people in a negative way? 
J: I don't know 'cause like one time in
 everyone's life they're gonna like think 
something like that it's just, I don't know. 
I: What think something like? 

J: Like Black people are gangsters kind of thi
ng, like if they [other people] think about 
it that's what's gonna probably come into th
eir head 'cause they see a lot of it like in 
the media and in TV and that as well, but 
then other things they will think as well. 
I: Like? 

J: Like slaves and stuff like that. Like a lo
t of black people are slave' s, like from ages 
ago. 
I: So do you think people aren't given en
ough positive or they're not given the correct 
information about black culture and// 
J: //yeah// 

I: //do you feel that it only focuses on like that th
ey were either slaves or that they're all 
gangsters now// 
J: //yeah// 

I: //that it just goes from one negative to the next? 
J: It [the media] doesn't really show any like nice like black people, they don't really 
focus on it they just focus on like all the things that black people do wrong. 
I: When you say they who do you mean? 

J: Like the media and stuff like that. 

I: So they just focus on all the stuff that 
black people, that they think are doing wrong. 
J: Yeah. 
I: Do you think that those things that they
 show, like people being gangsters, also apply 
though to white people and other people from other ethnicities? 
J: Um y eah sometime s. 

I: Why do you think though that they only show black people in that way? 

J: Sometimes they [the media] show like, Asians, they're like saying a lot about like 
Asian people and stuff like, Iraq people they
're showing a lot about them as well, 
because like of what like Saddam Hussein done
, like saying like all of them are like 
that but they're not, it's a bit harsh. 
I: So you think that they're also labelling people// 

J: //yeah// 
I: //in Iraq now// 
J: //yeah. 

I: Do you think they do the same to white people in the media? 

J: I don't hear much about it really but don't know they might do. 

I: They might do. 

J: Yeah, I don't hear much about it though. 
I: Is there anyone, because you mentioned Martin Luther King// 
J: //yeah. 

I: Is there anyone that is around today who you think is a good positive role model for 
black people and black children? 
J: Simon Webbe. 
I: Simon Webbe? 
J: Yeah. 

I: Why do you think he's a good role// 



 
390
J: //he's like just a normal person who hasn't done anything wrong, like he just sings 
really, just normal. 
I: Yes. 
J: Yeah, 'cause like, it's lik
e, everyone knows him like he's not English, like everyone 
knows him they don't say anything about him. 
I: And just finally, how would you usually describe your ethnicity? 

J: I'm half Jamaican and half English. 

I: Do you always say half? 

J: Yeah. I'm half Jamaican and half English.

Rose,13,"I: You've done two separate collages, so let's start with ‚how I see myself'. Do you 
want to go through the images and explain what they are and what you are trying to 
express? 
R: Sure OK. Well I really like art and fashion,
 that was the basis of it really, I like this 
photo [image of a woman applying make-up and party girls] because I like to party 

and I'm a bit of a poser, but I'm sort of
 like ‚cause I'm quite down if people want, 
and I like people to say stuff to my face you know I don't like people talking about 
me behind my back, it's like go on do it [image of a heart with ‚break my heart'], and 

then I really like fashion and shoes so that
 was the basis between them two [image of 
a female model and boots], and that one [image 
of a collage of girls] I just really love 
the picture I don' t know why, there's just something about it that I really like. 
I: Right. 
R: Don't know, just a collection of photos, I really like photography. 
I: And what does this word say? 

R: Well I was gonna, there's a quote and ‚she 
reads too many fashion magazines' and I 
was gonna finish that so. 
I: So if you were going to use some words to explain the pictures and how you see 
yourself, what would you use? 
R: Arty, daring, chic and confident. Yeah 
I am confident, I do a lot of drama and acting 
and stuff so. 
I: So let's move onto how yo
u think other people see you. 
R: Yeah. 

I: Now you' ve used black and white pictures 
here. You've got one picture of zebra's 
and another of a girl. Let's start with the gi
rl in the coat [how I think other people see 
me]. 
R: Well people always tell me that I have a cool like dress sense and I thought that was 
quite cool, and she's laughing and I'm us
ually quite happy and making people laugh 
so that was that. 
I: You've got a white zebra standing amongs
t other zebra's, what does that represent? 
R: People think that I stand out from the cr
owd a lot and think I'm different and stuff 
like that so. 
I: In what way do they think you're different? 

R: Well, I don't know, they just think like I sort of break the boundaries with like 
fashion, the way I am and music and all that, because I have quite a lot of friends that 
are into R&B and hip hop but they don't judge you on what you listen to, I listen to 
totally different stuff to them like Franz Fe
rdinand but yeah so, I try to be my own 
person. 
I: So do you think that there's a differenc
e between how you see yourself and how you 
think other people see you? 
R: Not, there's not much of a difference I don't think. 
I: So where would the difference be? 

R: I'm not sure. 



 
391
I: What do you personally feel because we
've got fashion and standing out from the 
crowd and that' s evident in these images, but if you wer e to pinpoint any differences 

what do you think they would be? 
R: Um, I think people when they, if they first see me they think that I'm gonna be a bit 
of a bitch and that I'm over-confident and have a big ego and all this. 
I: Why do you think they'd// 

R: //I think because I do a lot of acting, I don
't know, I know I have quite a serious face 
sometimes so I think that people think I'm 
like giving them evils and all this but I'm 
not really, quite a nice person to get along with quite funny. 
I: I've also noticed that you've not used an
y pictures of celebrities or film or television 
programmes. Why is that? 
R: I try and be my own person, I don' t really follow a certain person. 

I: So you just really prefer to be your 
own person and don't want to follow somebody? 
R: Yeah. 
I: Is there anybody that you think 
is a positive role model for you? 
R: Yeah, Nicole Ritchie and Johnny Depp. 

I: What is it about them// 

R: //well Johnny Depp he's like really differen
t, he's a really good actor he got me into 
acting he inspired me to do that, he's not in
to all the like media stars he's like just a 
regular family guy and likes to stay out of the whole spotlight. 
I: And what about Nicole Ritchie? 

R: She's just really cool, I like the way that 
she, she like got over all her addictions and 
all that that she used to have and yeah, quite cool. 
I: OK and just finally, how would you usually describe your ethnicity? 

R: Half Chinese and half English. 
I: Would you always say you were half Chin
ese and half English, or is there ever a 
situation where you might just say I'm Chinese or I'm English? 
R: Well I don't think so I mean the questi
on doesn't really crop up so much I don't 
think, but I'm not ashamed of who I am, so I just say it. 
I: Is it important for you to, if people do ask, is it important for you to not deny the 
Chinese// 
R: //yeah// 

I: //Chinese part of you, if you get what I'm driving at? 

R: Yeah, yeah. 

I: Would you feel right if you in saying I am English? 

R: Well it wouldn't feel wrong but I am half
 Chinese as well so, you know, I just don't 
see a problem with it so I just say that. 
I: OK that's brilliant. Thank you. 

 

(B=Brian, aged 13, male; I=interviewer) 


I: Let's start with ‚how I see myself'. Do you want to go through the images and 
explain what you are trying to express with them? 
B: Yeah, I like mu sic [Pussycat Dolls sign ] I like films [

I: Who is your favourite rapper? 

B: Eminem. 
I: Eminem. 
B: Yeah. 

I: What is it about Eminem that you like? 

B: His music. 

I: Yes, but what is it about his music that, why is his music in your eyes better than// 

B: //his lyrics. 
I: So why do you like his lyrics? Why do you identify with his music, why do you find 
it appealing? 
B: Um, I don't know I just, I don't know really, I don't know. 

I: OK let's move onto how you think other people see you. Do you want to go through 
the images there? 
B: I'm quite quiet and kind and er. 
I: You've got a picture of a guy with a gu n. 

B: Yeah probably brave and sporty. 

I: So do you think there's a difference between how you see yourself and how you think 
other people see you? 
B: Yeah. 
I: What's the difference? 

B: Um, there isn't really is there. 

I: But do you feel there is a difference?

Keira,14,"I: So Keira, you've just done ‚how I see myself'. 

K: Yeah. 
I: Do you want to go through the images? 
K: Um yeah well it's not very girlie obviously but a lot of it is like, I do a lot of motor 
sport and that and I play a lot of games and I'm also in the army cadets. 
I: Right. 

K: I'm bit of a rock chic with the guitars 
and Motorhead and that and the Status Quo and 
that and of course I'm also into like 
technology with downloading things from the 
internet and that. 
I: And you've also got a picture here of scenery [i mage of a lake]. 

K: Yeah. 

I: What does that mean? 

K: It's kind of like um photography, a lot of the places you go to do motor sport and that 
you get a lot of like in Scotland. 



 
393
I: Going back to the music that you like, 
because you said you are a bit of a rock chic, 
what is it about that type music that you like?
 What is it about that type of music that 
you identify with? 
K: Well I'm a guitarist so it's obviously wi
th guitar and solo and beats and things. 
I: Right OK. So what types of bands do you really like, because you've got Motorhead 
and Status Quo, would they be rock 
‚n' roll bands that you really like? 
K: Yeah. 

I: What is it about them in particular t
hough, because there are lots of rock bands like 
them, what is it about them in particular that
 you really like? So let's start with Status 
Quo, what is it about their music and them that you identify with? 
K: Well it's like a free type of music with lik
e, it can be simp le and difficult and it can 
also be like, like Status Quo music is quite
 upbeat and it's quite a joy to listen to and 
then of course with them playing it as well they put personality into it as well. 
I: So, y ou think that they've got// 
K: //yeah, they've got quite a lot of personality. 
I: And what about Motorhead? 

K: They're just like a proper, a proper rock band kind of thing. Heavy rock, yeah, yeah, 
it's a lot of heavy rock which is quite good. 
I: You've used the phrase rock chic// 
K: //yeah// 
I: //what is being a rock chic? 

K: Being into rock music and guitars and 
things that people associate with rock like 
legends. 
I: And what is, apart from the musical style, what is it about rock that you like? What is 
it specifically about rock, what do you think rock music in general expresses or what 
do you think you identify with? 
K: I don't know really . 

I: Because some people might say, for example, it sounds all the same, it's just the same 
old beat, it's just guitars. 
K: Yeah but a lot of people, I have a different taste in music, you could like ask most of 
the people in my class and they'd say R&B or pop or stuff that's in the charts 
nowadays whereas I don't hang with that stuff 
‚cause I go like the legend rock artists 
rather than up-to-date people. 
I: What is it about up-to-date people, why is 
it that y ou can't engage with that, that y ou 
don't identify with that in the same way you do with rock? 
K: Because I don' t find it very interesting to
 listen to, R&B sounds all the same and like 
some of the pop and all dance stuff sounds ma
inly the same as well. With rock you 
can get like slow rock or melodic rock or 
hard rock and there are actually different 
types, whereas other people would see it 
as it sounds all the same but personally I 
don't. 
I: Right OK. Now on how you think other people see you, you've not done anything. 
Is that because of time or// 
K: //yeah I didn't start until late in one of the lessons. 

I: If you did have time, what type of imag
es would you have put in how you think other 
people see you? 
K: Mainly the same. 

I: Mainly the same. 
K: Yeah. 
I: Would there be any differences? 

K: Um I'm not sure really. 

I: Do you think how other people see you is exactly the same as how you see yourself? 

K: I don't know, it's difficult, no I don't know. 
I: Is there anytime where you think somebody might look at you and think something 
that you just don't feel about yourself? 
K: Um (long pause). 



 
394
I: Oh and you said you were a member of the army cadets. 
K: Yes, yeah yeah. 

I: Do you think that people find that an acceptable thing for girls to do? 
K: No they don't. Some of the people at th
e army don't find it because they're just, out 
of all sixteen of us there are four girls the rest of them are boys, and some of the boys 

they don't involve you because they don't think that you should be there. 
I: On what basis? 

K: The fact that you have to run around on a field with a gun and the fact that girls 
shouldn't do that, they should stay at home and do things like cooking and cleaning 
and things. 
I: So do you feel that people are being quite sexist towards women or do you think 
that's just a bad experience? 
K: There's a few that think that girls shouldn
't be in it, like some give leeway and say 
well they can try it and if they don't like it then obviously they're gonna quit, but 
most people just put you down straight away. 
I: Do you ever have that in any other areas of your life though, where you feel because 
you're a girl you shouldn't be doing something 
or you're expected to behave a certain 
way// 
K: //yeah, in like the rally sport that I do
, it' s you and the services and there' s no other 
girls in my league so you get, if you try to talk to someone like a boy driver they can 
like step back a bit and think ‚mmm do you know
 anything' kind of thing, and then of 
course you get to know everyone and then they're alright, but a lot of people don't 

think yeah should she be in this league and so on and so forth. 
I: Do feel you have to prove yourself as a woman; do you feel like you have to work 
harder? 
K: Yeah, I do, to get people to understand th
at, your not a girlie girl walking around in 
pink you don't walk around and go to town a
nd think about girlie things which, I 
normally don't, but when you do something like that [motor sport] you have to 

persuade people like boys, and that you have
 to persuade them lots, you're not what 
they think. 
I: Interestingly, you've spoken about rock 
as well but rock music which is quite male 
dominated// 
K: //y eah, y eah// 

I: //so are there any female figures in rock
 that you particularly identify with? 
K: Kelly Clarkson. 

I: What is it about Kelly Clarkson that you identify with? 
K: She's very down to earth and her music is
 quite good and she like puts something into 
the music as well so she has the rock behind her. 
I: When you say she always puts something into her music, I'm not sure what you 
mean? 
K: She writes it and then she'll sit there 
and she'll have like ses sion guitarists and 
session drummers and that, and she gives th
em like a sample of what she thinks 
sounds good, and then she might change it or keep it like that, so she puts a rock 

effort into the music as well. 
I: So do you think that she has a lot of control over what she is doing? 

K: Yeah, a positive role model for girls like me. 

I: Who do you think is a negative role model? 
K: I think that the people in R&B take drugs or hit people and are bad. 
I: Are there any artists or mu sicians that you can name specifically? 

K: Not off the top of my head no, but you hear of it a lot of the time on TV and in 
magazines or it's due to their videos and their music that people react the way they 

do. 
I: What do you mean? 
K: You get like, like if you look at R&B if you l
ook at that, a lot of singers will be in the 
news because they've hit someone or done
 something and of course the young people 



 
395
turn around and think that looks good yeah I'll try that being a R&B singer means 
you can hit people, whereas y ou can't so a lot of people think it's right if they do it 

but it's not. 
I: And just finally, how would you usually describe your ethnicity? 
K: I'm Australian. 

I: You're Australian. 

K: M mm. 

I: Were you born here? 

K: No I was born in Adelaide in Melbourne. 
I: How long have you lived here? 
K: Thirteen years so I came here when I was really young. 

I: So you've lived here most of your life? 

K: Yeah. 

I: But you still call yourself Australian// 
K: //y es. 
I: Would you ever call y ourself English or British? 

K: Um, if I had to yeah, a lot of people have like grudges against the Australian for some 
reason, or like after the cricket (laughs), but sometimes if you don't feel like people 

are going to like you because your nationality then you say yeah I'm English. 
I: So if you feel like people are going to respond badly to the fact that you are saying 
you are another// 
K: //change it// 

I: //will say you're English. 

K: yeah. 

I: Has that ever happened to you? 
K: Um yeah a couple of times, it's like you s
it down in lessons and they go through who 
are you and where do you come from and so on and so forth and you always say 

England. If people found out y ou're an O
zzy you get, I don't know, you get labelled 
in the way th at you should speak in
 an Australian accent and you should know 
everything about Australia and you should live over there and not here and so on and 
so forth and then they say why don' t you go
 back and y ou say well because the rest of 
my family live here. 
I: That's brilliant, thank you. 

 

(L=Lucy, aged 13, female; I=interviewer) 


I: Are these two separate collages or one// 
L: //um yeah they are two. 

I: They're two. OK do you want to start with ‚how I see myself' and go through the 
images and explain what you are trying to express, what they mean to you? 
L: Well I've got a loads of make-up on ther
e and it's 'cause I do use a lot of make-up 
and who I am really, I've got straighteners '
cause I straighten my hair and I've got 
Beyonce 'cause I kind of idol her, she's like 
really pretty and her hair's always nice 
and I've always like her. Some of my friends have said that the way I act is like 

Jessica Simpson so I put her in there so I 
thought OK then so, gossip I like a bit of 
gossip. I like kids so I put that there and I'm also I'm quite sporty so I put a sports 

person on to show that. I'm English so I put England up there. 
I: And who are these, the Pussycat Dolls? 
L: Yeah, the Pussycat Dolls. 

I: Why are they// 

L: //well their music is good they're really good at singing and I like singing and they do 
dancing as well and I like dancing to so. 
I: Just going back to Beyonce you said you really like her and thought she was pretty. 
What is it about her that you think you identify with? 



 
396
L: She's so outgoing and like she's got he
r mind set on her dancing and I've got my 
mind set on dancing and singing, and she does that all the time an d I sing and dance 

all the time, that's what I want to do that's why really. 
I: And Jessica Simp son you said people say you act like her, in what way? 
L: In the way I dance and someti mes I can be
 a bit stuck up and, there's a programme on 
TMS about Jessica Simpson's life and I always watch it with my friends and she acts 

a bit stuck up so it's like, in like the st
uck up way sometimes you can be like that. 
I: So if you were going to use a few words to sum up how you see yourself, what type 
of words would you use? 
L: I'm quite outgoing and saucy and I really li
ke dancing but I can be a nasty, stuck up 
and selfish. 
I: Now moving on to how you think ot
her people see you, do you want to// 
L: //yeah I put ‚bitch' [word] because I'm like 
in a group of six people and we're all like 
really bitchy to each other sometimes and we 
always say that and I think I can be a bit 
of a bitch. I can be a little brat because 
in a way I'm quite spoilt, but yeah I think 
sometimes I'm a bit of a brat the way I act. 
I: Spoilt by? 

L: Spoilt by my mum really. ‚Party people' [words] I like going to parties and stuff like 
that so I put that there, ‚style' [word] I like to have my own style, ‚loud' [word] I'm 
really loud I know I'm loud ‚cause of what 
I do, wrong, I'm always like wrong like if 
people ask me a question I get it wrong and I know I'm wrong I just get a lot of things 

wrong. 
I: Does that frustrate you, that you get things wrong? 

L: Sometimes 'cause sometimes it makes me f
eel a little bit stupid but then sometimes I 
don't really mind 'cause that's who I am, and I put the picture of the baby there 
'cause I can be quite babyish and stuff like that and I don't actually know why I put 
that there because// 
I: //the word ‚gay'// 

L: //y eah I think every one told me to put it up there and they said oh you're gay like that 
and I was like OK, ‚cause someone said to me you're gay today like that and I was 
like OK I'll put it up there. 
I: Gay as in? 

L: Not as in actual gay, like lesbian gay, gay as in like happy// 

I: //happy// 

L: //yeah happy and stuff like that. 

I: So do you think there's a difference between how you see yourself and how you think 
other people see you? 
L: Um y eah I do. 

I: What are the major differe nces? 

L: People don't really notice that I dance and sing a lot, well all my friends in the class 
do and stuff like that and the bit about bitch,
 loud and stuff like th
at I think about that 
in myself as well as other people so I think I agree with them on that kind of thing. 
I: So you actually agree with what you think// 

L: //yeah// 

I: //how y ou think ot
her people see you// 
L: //yeah. 

I: If you had more time are there anymor
e images that you would have added? 
L: I'd put a picture of my family up there ‚cause I quite like being with my family and 
I'm quite like family orientated really. 
I: And I just want to go back to the make
-up because you've used a picture of Estee 
Lauder which is obviously a brand we all know// 
L: //mmm// 
I: //when you use make-up is the brand important to you or// 



 
397
L: //not particularly but 'cause I've got so
 much make-up I've spent so mu ch money on 
make-up and I thought because that's quite e
xpensive as well, I put that there to show 
that I do use like a lot of make-up and it does add up to quite a bit of an expense. 
I: And just finally I asked you how you would usually describe your ethnicity, what 
would you usually say? 
L: Well I don't know really ‚cause I'm stuff of my mum and my dad and my dad's Irish 
my mu m's Italian and I'm English so, and 
I don't, so that would make me quarter 
Irish, quarter Italian and half English. 
I: So if somebody asked would you say I'm a quarter this I'm a quarter that, or would 
you just say I'm English or I'm British or, what one would you usually say? 
L: I'd say I'm like quarter this quarter that. 

I: Is it important to you to say I'm a quarter
 Italian, I'm a quarter Irish, is it important// 
L: //yeah it is because I quite like people to know that I'm not all English, not like that 
there's anything wrong with English but just like them to know my background 
though. 
I: Why is that, do you know? 

L: Well me and my friends are like that we tell, if any one asks, we tell them what really 
it is and then they actually know what it is, tell them the truth really. 
I: OK that's brilliant. Thanks.

I: Tim, are these two separate collages or one? 

T: They're two. 

I: They're two and you've got a section in the middle? 
T: Yes. 
I: Shall we start with ‚how I see myself'? Do you want to just go through the images 
and explain what you are trying to express with each of them? 
T: That's for playing guitar, that's 'cau
se I like reggae music and that's 'cause I like 
music as well// 
I: //Bob Marley// 
T: //no, it's Hendrix (laughs). 

I: Sorry.

eep, and that's sheepish and I've got like a 
cleft lip and palette that's like when you 
get when you're born and she's got one as 
well. 
I: Who is that? 
T: Carmit from Pussycat Dolls. 

I: Right. 

T: And that's calm// 

I: //so the image of the woman doing yoga. 
T: Yeah. 
I: We'll move on to how y ou think other 
people see you. Do you want to go through 
these images? 
T: That's loud, happy and that's crazy and 
that's 'cause I had long hair when I was 
doing the collage, and that's 'cause I like f
ood and that's 'cause I like sport and that's 
mad. 
I: You've got the mad and the sporty person and the food in the middle// 
T: //yeah. 

I: So do you think there's a difference between how you see yourself and how you think 
other people see you? 
T: Yeah. 
I: What is the difference? 
T: Someti mes I act differently when I'm 
on my own and sometimes I act differently 
when I'm with other people. 



 
398
I: Right because on this side [how I think other people see me] you've got stuff like 
loud and mad, but on this side you'
ve got calm, on how you see yourself. 
T: Yeah. 
I: Do you think that other people see that side of you, because here [how I see myself] 
you've got calm and sleepy and sheepish, do you think other people see that side of 

you or do you think they only really see one side of you? 
T: Sometimes so. 

I: If you had more time are any other images th
at y ou would have liked to have added? 
T: Probably not. 
I: OK and just finally how would you usually describe your ethnicity? 
T: British. 

I: Do you say British or do you say English? 

T: English. 

I: Which one would you usually use? 
T: English. 
I: Why would you say English and not British? 

T: 'Cause British is Scotland, Wales, an
d Ireland and England, but I'm just from 
England.

S: Yeah. 

I: OK you've done ‚how I see myself', do you want to just go through each of the 
images and explain what you are trying to express with them? 
S: Yeah, I love design and I love sort of
 interior design and I love how colours go 
together and I love interior design and designing houses. I did that [image of a 

female footballer] 'cause I love football, I 
think that girls who do football are really 
trying sort of thing, 'cause the girls are going round doing football even though sort 

the boy s sort of say ‚oh no you can't do it 'cause it's a boy s' sport'. 
I: So do you feel strongly about girls having equal status//

I: Do you think that girls and women in society now have equal status or do you think 
there's more that has to be done? 
S: There's more that has to be done yeah I 
think even though it's like they say you have 
equal rights, but it's just coming into practice. 
I: Right. 
S: I hate McDo nald's, I hate junk food, I'
m a really sort of healthy person, I'm a 
vegetarian and that's what I was trying to 
represent, same as that [image of a burger 
with cross through it]. 
I: Why are you vegetarian? 

S: I think it's wrong, wrong to kill, kill things that, I think it's wrong to kill things and I 
don't think it's fair that we should kill,
 but I don't mind people who don't have the 
same opinion as me 'cause everyone has a choice but personally I don't want to. 
I: And what is it about McDonald's
 specifically that you don't like? 
S: I just hate junk food. 

I: So it's junk food full stop// 
S: //yeah, full stop I can't stand it. 
I: What about this picture of Tony Blair here? 



 
399
S: Yeah I'm quite left wing I enjoy sort of left wing politics, I mean if I had to choose 
I'd probably go for Labour even though my dad's really right wing. 
I: What for you defines right wing and left wing? 
S: I don't know but I agree with more of their points [Tony Blair and Labour]// 
I: //like, can you give me an example// 

S: //that everyone is entitled to free health
 care, that every one is entitled to free 
education, even though I think sometimes though some of the things are wrong I 

mean I think I'm more, I think I agree with the Conservative's points on the Europe 

EU and Europe I prefer their policy on that. 
I: Right OK. 
S: Also that one, I love that picture// 

I: //babies// 

S: //and I love little kids and I l
ove having my little cousins around. 
I: And the butterfly? 
S: Nature and nature' s sort 
of there [image of cliffs]. 
I: Does that tie in with// 

S: //yeah and I'm also quite calm and that's sort of calming but if someone pushes me I 
can be quite annoyed and stuff. 
I: And we've got another kid's picture. 
S: And that's another thing 'cause I enjoy l
ooking after my brothers and teaching them 
and stuff and telling them about what I know and stuff. 
I: I've noticed that you've got a picture of Billy and Chrissie from 
EastEnders
. 
S: Yeah I think I try and be sort of, I don'
t really talk about my emotions a lot and I 
don't sort of, I try and be sort of hard and that reminded me of Chrissie sort of like 

keep things behind closed bars 'cause you don't have any friends around and I think 
that' s quite like me, but also I' ve put Billy there because he' s pushed around quite a 
lot and I'm quite easy to not manipulate but sort of// 
I: //people can take advantage of you// 

S: //yeah yeah at times. 

I: Now if you had time, because there's noth
ing under how you think other people see 
you, if you had time to create a collage 
here would the two sides be different? 
S: Yeah. 

I: In what way? 

S: I think people see me, I think that sort of
 picture of Billy would come up a lot more 
and I think people see me as a lot more sort of academic sort of try and do science 

and maths and English even though I'm rubbish
 at English. I think people see me as 
odd and quite a strange person sort of like, I don't know. 
I: Why do you th ink th at is? 

S: I sort of, um very , I have quite strong be
liefs and I think a lot of people have got to 
get through. 
I: Do y ou think other people think that if 
you are very strong in your beliefs, do you 
think people see that as a positive or a negative thing? 
S: I don't know 'cause I'm willing to listen 
to other people's point of view and I'm 
willing to compromise, but I think someti mes 
peo ple just get into the habit that I 
won't be able to compromise and they can't talk to me about a subject. 
I: So if you were going to use images to represent that, can you th ink of any images that 
you might use? 
S: U m (pause) not talking, um someone sort of standing out and different, a bit strange. 
I: And just finally, how would you usually describe your ethnicity? 

S: English. 

I: English. Do you always say English? 

S: Um I don't know, I think I'd say I'm English but I don't know why. I know I'm from 
Britain I am British but I don't know I'd just
 say English I think it's more local than 
British.

I: One collage. Do y ou want to go through the imag es and explain what y ou were 
trying to represent and express with the images and the words?

rson and I thought Ant and Dec were quite 
fun so I put a picture of them down, my dad 
thinks I'm loyal so I stuck a picture of a 
dog and a Crazy Frog represents 'cause I'm

Keith,13,"I: Keith, you've done two separate collages but you've drawn the images. Now why 
didn't you use any of the images that were supplied? 
K: Because none of the images seemed to suit me. 

I: Why is that, because there was quite a wide variety? 

K: Because, because some of them were like
 sports and pop star magazines and I'm not 
really interested in those kinds of things like cars. 
I: OK, what types of images would you have liked? Are there any magazines or books 
or programmes that you would have liked images from? 
K: Well I like images from th e paranormal and things weird because I like to investigate 
those sorts of things because I'm 
interested in the paranormal. 
I: So let's start with ‚how I see myself'. 
K: Well I used the yin-yang sign for balan
ced because most people would punch other 
people for insulting them but I don't, I keep my temper under control so that's why 

I'm balanced. 
I: And you've also put here that you do martial arts. 

K: Yeah, I do karate and self-defence so if anybody tries to attack me I can defend 
myself. 
I: And what do these two mean? 

K: Well I used t he Irish flag because I' m l u
cky because I have a loving family and I'm 
used to getting through most of my life with
 luck and my family, I come from Ireland 
and we're an Irish fa mily basically . 
I: And you've also got that you like basketball. What is it about basketball that you 
like? 
K: Well I just like playing it for fun and it's the kind of sport I can get into not like 
football I hate football. 
I: What is it about football that you dislike? 

K: Well I don't quite understand the rules 
very well and when it comes to somebody 
kicking the ball towards me it either hits
 me in the face or in other places. 
I: And you're also interested in the parano
rmal and you're double-jo inted. What is it 
about the paranormal that you identify with? 
K: Well I'm interested in the fact that, in
 the paranormal like ghosts and everything, 
because some things can't be explained and 
others can and that's why I'm interested 
in the paranormal because there's some spirits on the other side trying to 
co mmunicate with us and that helps me believe that there's a n afterlife, life after 

death, so I won't actually have to worry about death after that. 



 
402
I: OK, let's move on to how you think othe
r people see you. You've written ‚funny', 
‚different', ‚normal', ‚weird' and ‚strange
'. Now normal and weird and strange, don't 
they go against one another? 
K: U m yeah. 
I: So what do they// 

K: //well weird as in, when it comes to like 
football and everything which is the sport I 
hate I'd just like to sit back and read 
a book that's why people would call me weird, 
and freaky because I do like my
 double-joints, and normal because I sometime stay 
with the crowd and other people. 
I: In what type of situations would you stay with the crowd? 
K: Well, if I'm like talking with my frien
ds while we're walking along and everything I 
just act like I'm doing my own thing and that's why I defer as normal. 
I: You've written the word ‚disgusting' here as well, what do you mean by that? 

K: Well if you had a pencil case I would show you but you don't have one with you right 
now. 
I: Right. 

K: But disgusting like double-jointed thumb a
nd I can make my hands go really far back. 
I: Do you think people don' t really see who you are, or how you really feel about 
yourself? 
K: Um, I don't know really because, well, the reason these two are different is because 
how people think and see me, I just sometimes 
act and talk to people, whenever I do a 
few things that they either decry me as one of those things [weird and freaky]. 
I: Does that upset you? 

K: No because I know everybody is different
 and that doesn't worry me, but sometimes 
it does tick me off when other people ca
ll me gay because I'm not gay and it just 
really annoys me. 
I: So they mean gay as in homosexual? 

K: Yeah. 

I: And they are saying that in a negative way? 

K: Yeah. 
I: Do you think that being gay is a negative thing? 
K: Not really because it doesn't matter if you're gay or not, you're just normal and it's 
basically your choice. 
I: And just finally, how would you usually describe your ethnicity? 

K: Ethnicity , um, I would say I'm Irish because my family , because my family they're 
Irish because I come from an Irish family I w
ould be declared as Irish but I can't here 
because I live in Britain so 
I'm declared as English. 
I: So if somebody asked you what would you say? 

K: I would say I'm Irish but I live in Britain. 

I: Were you born here? 

K: Well yes I was born here but I do come from an Irish family. 
I: And it's important for you to maintain that. 
K: Yeah. 

I: OK that's brilliant.

I: I'd just like it if you could go through the pictures and explain what you're trying to 
express with each of the images. 
C: I put Converse there because like I wear th
em quite a lot and um, and I've put like 
um// 



 
403
I: //Green Day// 
C: //Green Day 'cause I really like them a nd 
I've put that [image with colours] 'cause 
like loads of colours it's 'cause I'm quite 
bubbly and I've got loads of like sides to 
myself sort of thing, not like in a nasty 
way, I' ve put an eye because like people see 
me as quite I'm quite nosey and I like watching and Chrissie Watts [
EastEnders
 
character] 'cause she's like a bit of a, she'
s loud ain't she and I feel that I'm quite 
loud. 
I: I just want to go back to Green Day, now you obviously like their music// 

C: //yeah. 
I: What is it about them though that you identify with? 
C: 'Cause like I've got a guitar and everythi
ng as well I like playing that type of music 
it's not just them I like punk music and that it's 
 like their type of music, their sort of 
like I look up to them. 
I: Why do y ou look up to them? 
C: 'Cause I think they're really good at playing music and that and I like to play music. 
I: So do you think they are positive role models? 

C: Yeah yeah. 

I: What ty pe of positive things do you think that they do, or how in y our ey es are they 
positive? 
C: Well I don't know, they're not very positive 
they're quite moody actually but it's just 
like their music and everything. 
I: OK let's move on to how you think other people see you, do you want to explain// 

C: //yeah I put like Christine Aguilera 'cau
se every one see s me that I'm like he r just 
'cause I look like her. 
I: So it's nothing to do with personality? 
C: No it's just 'cause people see me, they th
ink that. Like when they see me 'cause I 
wear make-up a lot, they probabl
y think I like the Pussycat Dolls. 
I: And do you? 

C: No I hate them. 

I: Why do you hate them? 
C: I don't know my sister likes them I just don't like their music really much. 
I: So you're not really into pop? 

C: Um well it depends, I do like some pop 
music but I just don't like Cat Dolls// 
I: //them// 

C: //yeah. I've got jewellery 'cause like I 
wear quite a lot of jewellery and I like 
accessories and I quite like that picture it's like black and white it's plain and then 
inside you can see it's colourful [image of 
an eye], and people see me as a plain and 
boring person but inside I'm sort of
 wacky and thingy and weird like that. 
I: So do you think how you think other people 
see you is completely different to how 
you see yourself// 
C: //yeah. 
I: Why do you th ink th at is? 
C: At school like I haven't got many friends 
so and like people see me and I don't really 
walk around like I would when I'm with my 
friends, I'm quite qu iet in front of like 
other people in the school and that's probably why. 
I: Does it bother you th at other people don't see what you are trying to express, like 
how I see myself? 
C: Yeah. 
I: It does bother you? 

C: Yeah. 

I: Do you think there's anything you can do to get over that? 

C: Not really no, I don't know. 
I: You don't know. 
C: No. 

I: And just finally how woul
d you usually describe your ethnicity, what would you say? 



 
404
C: I'd say that I was English but if I had to
 go into more detail I'd say I'm like half 
Welsh. 
I: Half Welsh. 
C: Yeah. 
I: But you say you're English? 

C: Yeah. 

I: Were you born in England? 

C: Yeah I was born in England and my dad's Welsh. 

I: Do you consider any part of yourself Welsh or do you consider yourself completely 
English? 
C: I consider myself sort of bit Welsh becau
se of my dad but if somebody came u p to me 
in the street I would just say I was Eng
lish 'cause that's where I was born and most 
of my family are English so yeah. 
I: OK brilliant.

I: Is this one big collage or two?

se how I see myself and how other people see me 
is like same thing. 
I: So do you just want to go through the images and explain what you were trying to 
express with each of them? 
C: Yeah. Well on that one [word ‚respect'] there's like, I like treating people with like 
respect and I think they should have the same respect as everyone else so I put that 

one there. 
I: And you've got Patsy Kensit there, why have you used her? 
C: Becaus e in 
Emmerdale
 she's like quite bitchy and I can be quite bitchy sometimes but 
not, if I said something I will say it to someone not behind their backs I think that's 

harsh. 
I: And you've also got some babies here. 
C: Yeah because I like children and stuff and 
I'd like to work with children and stuff I 
think y eah, and like I want to have
 children when I'm older as well. 
I: And then next to the children you've got some guns// 

C: //oh (laughs) I didn't mean to put that th
ere it's just like the last one I done, but I 
don't think gun crime is right and stuff and 
I don't think they should give it to people 
'cause people shouldn't die without a reason. 
I: So y ou are ac tually anti-gun? 
C: Yeah yeah. 

I: And you've got a picture of the UK and Ireland. 

C: Yeah. 

I: Why is that? 
C: Because I come from Britain and stuff and I'll probably always live in Britain only 
'cause I like it. 
I: What about the tiger? 

C: Well I'm quite nice and stu
ff but people say if I get like 
aggressive I get like quite, 
not like aggressive and stuff, but I can get quite angry and feisty and stuff yeah. 
I: And you've got water// 
C: //because I can be like quite calm and stuff and I'm like, my star sign is like Aquarius 
so I put that 'cause it's like water. 
I: And you've got a patchwork elephant// 

C: //because some people say I'm like quite br
ight and colourful and bubbly and stuff 
and that's how I am. 
I: And you've got the word ‚bubbly' as well. 
C: Yeah. 

I: Now you've got some cleansing wipes a
nd the words ‚hair heaven', what is that? 



 
405
C: Because I want to be a lawyer when I'm older but if I had a second job it would be 
like beauty and hair and stuff because I always do like my sister's hair and 

everybody's hair and stuff and I just enjoy 
doing people's hair and like beautician and 
stuff so I'd like to do that. 
I: What does the ‚Jam Festival' [words ] mean? 

C: Oh it's meant to be like music and st
uff 'cause I like quite a lot of music. 
I: So do you think that there are any differences between how you see yourself and how 
you think other people see you? 
C: I think I'm, I can be quite horrible and quite nasty and stuff but people say I'm not 
like that but they say I'm like nice and stuff and I always try and help people and stuff 
and all that and all the teachers say I try an
d help people but that just comes naturally 
to me and I don't do it just to do it, I do it 
'cause it just comes to me to do that mayb e 
'cause I'm a girl. 
I: So it's just in your nature? 
C: Yeah yeah. 
I: And just finally, how would you usually describe your ethnicity? 

C: I'd probably say I'm English probably, or British. 

I: Which one would you most probably use? 

C: British. 
I: Why would you say British and not English? 
C: Because like Great Britain is like the whole country and I see myself as part of the 
co mmunity , and English is like just one bit and it's like kind of like separated, if you 

say Britain it's kind of join ed so like more
 people like me are in Scotland and Wales 
and stuff and like Great Britain is like one country it's not divided. 
I: OK that's brilliant. Thanks.

Joel,13,"I: Is this one collage or is it two separate collages? 

J: It's like kind of, no it's a bit of both I think. 
I: You've got quite a few images. 
J: Yeah. 

I: Do you want to go through the images and explain what you are trying to represent 
and express with them? 
J: Well the football is obviously 'cause I kind of like football quite a bit, I quite like into 
fashionable clothes and I like women. 
I: So y ou've really got sport, fashion and wo men. 

J: Yes. 

I: What about this guy with the hand over his face? 

J: Because of the fashion symbol there. 
I: And you've got the England flag. 
J: That's like the country that I was born in. 

I: What is it about football that you like? 

J: I don't know, I just support football rea
lly and I just like playing in a team. 
I: When you play football is it the taking part that's important or is it the winning that is 
important to you? 
J: The taking part, it's not just about winning is it really, but yeah, it's good to win. 
I: And also the fashion, is it important for you to wear designer clothes? Is the name 
important? 
J: Yes. 

I: Why? 
J: I don't know it just is, I'd just rather 
wear so methin g like that instead of something 
from Tesco's or something like that. 
I: Are there then, even within designer la
bels, are there certain names yo u'd class as 
cool and certain names that you don't class as cool// 
J: //yeah. 

I: So what would be a cool designer to wear? 
J: Armani, things like that. 
I: What is it about them that you think is cool? 

J: It's just, it's just the name it's just
 fashionable everyone knows who they are and 
things like that. 
I: So it's because everyone knows the name// 
J: No it's just fashionable innit. 
I: What if I had an Armani top// 

J: //yeah// 

I: //and I had exactly the same top but it didn
't have the label Armani on it. Would it 
still be cool? 
J: Erm yeah but it would, I don't know that's a difficult question, I don't know but I 
think it would be better if it had the label, I don't know it just would in my eyes. 
I: Do you wear designer clothes// 

J: //yeah// 

I: //outside of school? 

J: Yeah. 
I: You do. 
J: Yeah. 

I: All the time? 



 
408
J: Pretty much yeah. 
I: How does that make you feel? Do you think people see you in a different light when 
you have designer clothes on? 
J: I don't know it's just how people see me 'cause that's what I just wear pretty much 
all the time so that's how people see me. 
I: OK and the other thing is women [how I see myself]. Now you've used women who 
are not wearing an awful lo t// 
J: //yeah. 

I: Is it women and girls in general that you 
like, or can you give me an example of any 
women that you think are particularly nice? 
J: It's not just like any group because you can get proper ugly people, like attractive 
women. 
I: So who do you class as attractive as an a ttractive wo man? 

J: Jennifer Lopez and people like that. 
I: Can you give me a couple of other names maybe? 
J: I don't know loads of people. 

I: Like. 

J: Mariah Carey, I don't know people like that. 

I: What is it about them that you think makes them attractive and appealing to you? 
J: The way they look. 
I: Who do you think isn't attractive? 

J: I don't know, er well it just, not like fat people, er. 

I: Or are there any famous people that are d
escribed as pretty and you think, no they're 
not, I don't think they are// 
J: //yeah Madonna I don't reckon. 
I: What about Paris Hilton? 
J: Yeah she's alright I guess. 

I: She's alright but she's not on the same level as Jennifer Lopez or Mariah Carey? 

J: Yeah yeah. 

I: What about Beyonce// 
J: //yeah she's good looking. 
I: She's good looking. 

J: Yeah. 

I: So do you think there's a difference between how you see yourself and how you think 
other people see you? 
J: Yeah probably. 
I: Where would the differences be? What would it be? 
J: Well it's a person's point of view isn't it? 

I: But if you were going to explain it to me, can you think of maybe something that 
somebody else might think of you that you think that's not how I see myself? 
J: Er, quite like, I don't know bossy, I don't know. 
I: Bossy. 
J: Yeah. 

I: Do you th ink other people see you as bossy? 

J: Yeah they could do I don't know, I don't really know how other people see me. 

I: OK and just finally how you would usually describe your ethnicity// 

J: //English. 
I: Do you ever say British? 
J: Say if I went on holiday and they asked what region like nationality I'd probably say 
English, no British actually yeah. 
I: What's the difference between English and British? 

J: I don't know it's just some people say English and some people say British, it's like 
some people say tomato and some people say tomato. 
I: Are they both the same thing? 

J: Yeah. 



 
409
I: They are? 
J: Mmm. 

I: OK cool. 
 
(H=Helen, aged 14, female; I=interviewer) 



I: Is this one collage or is it two separate collages? 

H: Two kind of like, in the middle there's mixing. 

I: So let's start with how you see yourself. Do you want to go through the images and 
explain what you're trying to express and represent with each of the images? 
H: OK. I put sport on there 'cause I like play sport and I like sport. I like gossip and to 
others I like talking about people. 
I: Right. 

H: I put a picture of the country where I live in and a circle round the bit Bournemouth 
and that. I put a picture of London because I go up there quite a bit, and I put a 
picture of pink GHD's [hair straighteners] because I can't live without them and a 

picture of a cat 'cause I like cats and Ri ver Island 'cause I like I love River Island. 
I: You said you like talking about other people// 

H: //yeah. 
I: What is it about that that you like and enjoy? 
H: Don't know, just like talking about people. 

I: Do you think that's it's OK to talk about 
people in a gossipy way if you're saying bad 
things about them? 
H: Not really but. 

I: You still do it. 
H: Yeah. 
I: So y ou are quite into fashion and you like clothes// 

H: //yeah. 

I: Is it important for you to feel like you are a fashionable person and taking care of the 
way that you look? 
H: Er y eah kind of. 
I: Let's move on to how you think other people see you. Do you want to explain them 
i mages and what you are trying to represent? 
H: Yeah, I put ‚attitude' [word] because I thi
nk that sometimes I can have a bit of an 
attitude towards other people. 
I: Right. 
H: And I think some people think I'm a bit gobby as well. I put a picture of 
Friends
 
[American sitcom], because I'm like always with my friends. 
I: You've put a picture of? 

H: 
Friends
. 
I: Right. 
H: I'm always on the run and can't sit still fo
r ages, and I put like sparkly so it's like 
bubbly sort of thing. 
I: Right, and in the middle you' ve put ‚I am what I am' [words]. So do you feel that 
this could be one collage? 
H: Yes. 

I: Do you th ink how yo u think other people see you is how you see yourself? 
H: Yeah. 
I: Or do you think there's a difference? 

H: I think it's mainly same really. 

I: Do you think that there are any differences though, like if you had more time to work 
on this [how I think other people see me] 
do you think that there would be any 
differences between the two sides? 
H: Yeah definitely if I had more time. 

I: What do you the differences would be? 



 
410
H: I don't know, um, I'm not sure. 
I: You're not sure. 

H: No. 
I: OK and just finally, how would you usually describe your ethnicity? 
H: British. 

I: Now do you always say British or do you say English? 

H: Either. 

I: Either. 

H: Yeah. 
I: What one do you use more often? 
H: Probably English. 

I: English. 

H: Yeah. 

I: Is there a difference between English and British or are they the same? 
H: They're the same, I think so. I think 
they're the same, just two words the same. 
I: So it's just two different words for the same thing? 

H: Yeah. 

I: OK that's brilliant. 

 
(N=Nancy, aged 13, female; I=interviewer) 


I: Is this one collage or is it two? 

N: Probably one. 

I: Do you want to go through the images and explain what you are trying to express 
with them? 
N: Yeah the dog is that I 
don't like animal cruelty becau
se like underneath it it's a bit 
like he's really lonely and everything 'cau
se I don't like how animals are treated like 
when they've make-up tested on them. 
I: Right. 

N: I think I'm quite happy , I like listening 
to mu sic, I just like the brightness of the 
flower I think I'm quite like, not bright like clever but// 
I: //bright as in an uplifting character// 

N: //yeah yeah I like my mobile, I really want that car when I'm older and that's where I 
live [image of UK map]. I think I respect people and that, and I'm quite calm// 
I: //so you've used the candle to represent calm// 

N: //yeah, and I gossip quite a lot about things like what you see on tele and that lot and I 
think people can trust me like if they want 
to say something like that no-one else 
wants to know, I keep a secret and that lot so. 
I: Right. You've mentioned animal cruelty// 

N: //yeah// 

I: //which you think is not acceptable, why do you think it's wrong? 
N: 'Cause no-one likes it when kids are trea
ted badly so why should animals be treated 
badly because, I know they haven't obviously got the same feelings as us but they 

know when the owners are doing something ho
rrible to them when they haven't done 
anything wrong, like little children, like you know the NHS I think it is// 
I: //yes// 

N: //they get treated, children go there 'cau
se they get treated badly so why should dogs 
get treated badly as well. 
I: Also you said that you like mu sic, wh at mu sic in particular do you mo st identify 
with? 
N: Pop. 

I: Are there any artists in particular that you// 
N: //not really , just like any kind of musi
c, not rock, I don't really like rock. 
I: What is it about rock
 that you don't like? 



 
411
N: It's that head banging if you know what I 
mean, there's not like a lot of singing it's 
just like music like noise. 
I: So what is it about pop that you like? 
N: Some of the words and that are quite good. 
I: Now I've noticed on your collage// 

N: //yeah// 

I: //I sort of get the impression that y
ou're quite a happy, bubbly type of person// 
N: //yeah// 

I: //but what I've noticed is there is not anything here which suggests maybe you get a 
little bit angry// 
N: //y eah I couldn't find anything. 

I: If you had more time or if there were ot
her things that you wanted to express on this 
about yourself// 
N: //yeah// 
I: //what types of things would you put down? 
N: I do get angry sometimes. 

I: What sorts of things make you angry? 

N: Animal cruelty if you see it on tele or li
ke children, you know you see those children 
adverts that don't have homes that makes 
me upset and angry, I do n't understand why 
they like do that, people do that
 to animals and their children. 
I: So do you think there's a difference between how you see yourself and how you think 
other people see you? 
N: Yeah. 

I: What do you think the difference is? 

N: I think like some people see me, 'cause I don't obviously like, I think they think I'm 
quite loud 'cause I do talk quite a lot so I think they think that but I'm not if you 
know what I mean. 
I: Do you think it's more, when they hear you express yourself, do you think that maybe 
they think that you're confident? 
N: Oh no, I'm not confident at all. 
I: But do you think other people think you are? 
N: Yeah, but when they get to know me they know I'm not, 'cause I work quite hard and 
that's why I worry a lot. 
I: Why don't you let other people see that side of you? 

N: 'Cause I don't want them to think that
 I'm like stupid or a whimp, 'cause I get 
worried about a lot of things. 
I: So, it's like you keeping that side to yourself// 
N: //yeah but my mum knows that I get worried and I talk to her about it if I have any 
problems and that lot and some of my friends I do, people I don't know I don't say it 

straight away but I wait until I get to know them. 
I: So it's like a defence// 
N: //y eah, y eah 'cause like if they think I'm 
not very clever they might not like me but 
all my friends obviously they like me because they know I' m not. 
I: Do you think if somebody didn't think you were clever and didn't like you off the 
back of it// 
N: //yeah// 

I: //do you think a person like that 
would be worth knowing at all// 
N: //no not at all, they should like me for who I am not what I'm gonna do, like my work 
and that lot. 
I: But do you think it alway s works out that way ? 

N: No, 'cause like mostly you're really up
set if somebody doesn't like you so, 'cause 
you can't probably be as clever as they are. 
I: You've not actually used many images of famous people// 
N: //yeah, I didn't have enough time. 



 
412
I: But if you could, are there any people that you think you would have put on, that you 
look to who you think are positive role models? 
N: Um. 
I: Or somebody that you look to that you think I aspire to want to be like that. 
N: Have you heard of um, I've co
mpletely forgotten her name now. 
I: What's she in? 

N: She's a singer, I don't know her name. 

I: What does she look like? 

N: She's got like; she had brown now she's got blonde hair. 
I: Kelly Clarkson? 
N: That's it; I like her music a lot. 

I: What is it about Kelly Clarkson that you like and identify with? 

N: 'Cause on her videos when sings it's not 
like she just stands there, it's like she 
expresse s how she's feeling in the words th
at she says, she actually expresses herself 
in the video she's not like just standing there singing it. 
I: Is there anything else about her, not just her music but the type of person that you 
think she is// 
N: //I think she's quite happy because I wa
tched an interview and she seemed quite 
happy and bubbly but I don't know if it's just for show, but she did seem happy and 
what not so I think she's being true, so that's good. 
I: And just finally, how would you usually describe your ethnicity? 

N: I'm English. 

I: If you had the choice between Eng
lish or British, what would you say? 
N: English, yeah. 

I: Do you think there's a difference though between English and British? 
N: Yeah I think so. 
I: What do you think the difference is? 

N: Is it just, aren't th ey like, 'cause British 
is the whole country, no it's not, am I wrong? 
I: What do you think? There's no right or wrong answer. 

N: No I don't know. 
I: Are you going to say that you think British is the whole country including Scotland, 
Wales and No rthern Ireland, whereas England is just England// 
N: //yeah// 

I: //so with England you are being more specific// 

N: //yeah// 

I: //about what country you come from// 
N: //yeah.

Josie,13,"male; I=interviewer) 

I: Is this one collage or is it two separate collages? 
J: It's just one big collage like what I am like and like how people see me. 

I: OK so let's start with ‚how I see myself'. Do you want to go through the pictures and 
explain what you are trying to represent with them? 
J: The candle's for quite calm 'caus e like I'm 
not, I'm not like relaxed all the time but 
I'm rel axed in a way. The colours because 
I'm quite colourful I wear quite colourful 
clothes and stuff outside of school. Th
e bear is because some people think I'm 
vicious but I'm not, because they're always like go on have a figh t with her and see 

who wins but I don't do that. 
I: Why do you think that they think you're vicious? 

J: Because I'm quite big and tall and yeah. 
I: Right OK, but you're not vicious. 
J: No. 

I: Are yo u violen t at all? Do you th ink you're an aggressive violent person// 



 
413
J: //no// 
I: //or do you think th
at's how people see you? 
J: I think not aggressive and violent but I think they think that I'm quite like vicious in a 
way. 
I: But you disagree with that. 

J: Yeah. 

I: OK. 

J: That's because I'm family orientated [word ‚family], I do a lot of stuff with my 
family. 
I: And you've also got the words ‚wrong' and ‚brat attack', what do// 
J: //'cause like wrong, um whenever my mum sa
ys something that I think is wrong I go 
wrong like that so I just put that up ther
e and then brat attack 'cause my mum is 
always saying like I'm a little brat and stuff. 
I: What about this boot? What's that for? 
J: U m 'cause I'm quite tall it's quite a big heel and I like shoes, I do like my shoes. 
I: And what about this picture 
of, do you know who this lady is? 
J: No. 

I: Her name is Marsha Hunt. 
Why have you got this picture? 
J: Because of my origin ‚cause I have a natu
ral afro, a huge afro, and it' s just like my 
origin like Jamaican, half Jamaican. 
I: And you've got a picture of Simon Webbe as well, why is that there? 

J: 'Cause I love my music I'm always listening to mus ic if its on in my room or I'm 
doing homework on the computer or something I always have to blaring out at full 

blast and that's why I've got ‚pump up the volume' [words] as well. 
I: Right. So do you think that, because there is quite a mixture, do you think that there 
is a difference between how you see yoursel
f and how you think other people see 
you? 
J: Yeah. 

I: What's the difference? 

J: Well people, 'cause I'm tall and not that 
skinny as other people then they might think 
that I'm the bear and quite, quite vicious and that but I'm not really like that, 
everyone has there moment when they feel
 like killing someone but I wouldn't go out 
and just randomly hit someone. If I'm angry I try and talk it through first and then 

like see how it goes from there type thing if you are still friends or break up or 

whatever. 
I: Do you think that it's just your size, your height // 
J: //yeah// 
I: // that makes people think about you in that way// 

J: //yeah 'cause I recently gone on a school trip and th is girl came up to me and said 
apparently you want to hurt me, what 
 have I done wrong? So someone has 
obviously said that I wanted hurt her for no reason. 
I: And also the picture of hair that you've u
sed is that something that people point out to 
you as well? 
J: Yeah, yeah, 'cause it's always
, 'cause I used to come to sc
hool with my afro and then 
I got really badly bullied and stuff like all the time people like, afro afro, like being 

really horrible about it and like throwing stuff at my hair and stuff like that. 
I: Why do you think that they were, why were
 they bullying you? Just because of the 
afro? 
J: I don't know. 

I: Do you think if y ou had big hair and it w
asn't an afro that they would have bullied 
you? 
J: I don' t know I' m not quite sure, but it' s because I did have a huge afro, a bit like that, 
and like I just got the mick taken out of me constantly. 



 
414
I: OK if y ou didn't have people taking the mick out of you and bullying y ou because o f 
that, do you think that you would still be 
happy enough to wear y our afro, to have 
your afro? 
J: Yeah. 
I: So would you, at some point, still like to have your afro back? 

J: Yeah. 'Cause I liked it I just liked it 
but now it just, I got bullied for like since I was 
in Year Seven. 
I: I've noticed like, when I spoke to your br
other, it is very evident that you are the only 
non-white person in your class. Is the bullying related to// 
J: //some of it is because I get some like 
‚oh go back to Pakistan' and ‚go away you 
Paki' and stuff like that and I used to say get your facts right, I'm not from Pakistan 

I'm from Jamaica type of thing, I'd always comeback with a comeback. 
I: Yes. 

J: I hate racism and if any one say s some
thing then I'll go say something back. 
I: Are you aware of it though, being in a school where you're not surrounded by many 
children from diverse backgrounds, are you aware that you are different from other 

people or does that only happen when somebody says something// 
J: //yeah 'cause I see myself as like a friend to
 everyone but there is occasionally, if I 
get in a ruck with so meon e they say someth
ing racist and then I'll be like well you 
couldn't have been a true friend any way if y ou can turn round and think some thing 
like that, so. 
I: And if you had more time are there any other images that you would have used? 

J: If I could have found one I'd probably have
 one of Whitney Houston 'cause I like to 
sing her songs and stuff and she's like an icon type thing. 
I: Why is she an icon? Apart from her musi
c, is there anything about her as a person 
that you identify with? 
J: Like the words in some of her music a
nd stuff they speak to me, the way she's so 
calm and she's like a role model for me. Then like on the pictures, love and family 

stuff. 
I: OK and just finally, how would usually describe your ethnicity? What would you 
usually say? 
J: Well I'd say my mum's English and my dad was Jamaican or is Jamaican, I don't 
know I haven't met him. 
I: Do you always explain that my mum is English// 

J: //yeah or sometimes I just say I'm half Jamaican and if I'm in a rush I say half 
Jamaican. 
I: Do you ever ju st say I'm English or British, or do you always make a point// 
J: //yeah I always make a point// 

I: //why do you do that? 

J: I don't know, it's just that I always ha
ve 'cause my mum brought me up to know that 
I was Jamaican so it's just been something 
that's been with me type thing, and some 
people they always think like with the wars going on they think you're a terrorist type 
thing and I'm not and they always think stuff like that so I make a point of telling 

them I'm Jamaican and then they're fine with it. Don't know why but. 
I: Is it important for you personally, apar
t from letting people know, do you feel like it's 
important for yourself to say this is part of who I am? 
J: Yeah 'cause people when they come ro
und to my house they only see my mum and I 
look nothing like my mum at all so they mi
ght, like they think how comes she's that 
colour and stuff so I always make a point of saying that my dad was Jamaican. 
I: Right OK. That's brilliant. 

 

(D=Damon, aged 14, male; I=interviewer) 

I: Are these two separate collages or one? 

D: Yeah. 



 
415
I: Let's start with ‚how I see my self', do you 
want to go through the images and ex plain 
what you were trying to express? 
D: OK, I'm a bit silly sometimes, I like a good 
bit of humour, I like technology, um and I 
like music and all that sort of thing quite a lot. 
I: And who is that, is it Eminem? 

D: No. 

I: What's that there for? 

D: I don't know it was already in that picture. 

I: Oh right. 
D: And so is that [image of men in white]. 
I: What does that one big image represent? 

D: Um just loads of things like th
at sort of style I sometimes wear. 
I: How would you describe the sort of style? Is it skateboardy or street or urban? 

D: I don't know, I just wear what I want when I want and when I feel like it really. 
I: Right. So if you were going to use so
me words to summarise the images and to 
explain how you see yourself, what types of words would sum up the collage about 

how you see yourself? 
D: Um silly, like to be up-to-date, um 
kind of weird and that's about it I guess. 
I: OK let's move on to how you think other people see you because that's a complete 
contrast because you've only used three things. Do you want to just go through them 
and explain why you've used them? 
D: Well that one// 

I: //the spade// 

D: //because I'm kind of clumsy and that because// 

I: //the Japanese cartoon// 
D: //because most of the ti me I am weird and that's [word ‚bastards' ] what some people 
usually think of me. 
I: What, that you're a bastard? 

D: Yeah. 

I: Why is that image weird? 
D: Because of the funny faces that they're pulling and everything. 
I: So do you think how you think other people see you is how you see yourself, or do 
you think there are any differences? 
D: It's kind of hard to understand what people think of you because you're not them I 
guess. 
I: But what do you think? 
D: Um probably. 
I: Probably? 

D: That they kind of do have a bit of a 
resemblance between how
 I see myself and how 
others see me. 
I: So you think they are the same? 
D: Kind of most likely, yeah probably. 
I: If you had more time are there any other images that you would have used? 

D: Probably found another silly one because 
I'm always like falling over or something or 
other or like doing something like embarrassing or something. 
I: And just finally how would y
ou usually describe y our ethnicity ? 
D: I think just British. 
I: Do you say British or do you say, because some people say British and some people 
say English? 
D: Um it depends where you come from in so
me parts of England like in London I know 
they say I' m British and in the country they say I' m English. 
I: So what do you say? 
D: British. 
I: Why do you say British? 

D: Shorter than English (laughs). 



 
416
I: Is that the only reason? 
D: Probably yeah and it sounds better than English. 

I: What is the difference, because 
y ou said in London they say British? 
D: It's kind of London slang I guess. 
I: So do you think saying English is posher? 

D: Yeah much. 

I: OK that's brilliant. 

 

(E=Ellie, aged 14, female; I=interviewer) 

I: Is this one big collage or is it two separate collages? 

E: One big collage. 

I: Can you ju st go through the images and explain what yo u are trying to express and 
represent wit h them? 
E: This one I drew a map, I cut out a map of England and circled round where I live. 
That one [word ‚gossip'] because I do like to gossip and I like those crisps// 
I: //what crisps are they , are they potato heads// 

E: //yeah Walkers. 

I: You've also got a picture of Sharon Osbourne, why did you use// 
E: //only because I like the 
X Factor
. 
I: You've also got this picture here of a lady playing football. 

E: Yeah that's Hope Powell the ma
nager of the girls' England team. 
I: Why have you used her? 

E: Because I like to play football and 
I want to be in the England team. 
I: So do you identify or respect her, or see her as a role model? 
E: Yeah. 
I: What about this [image of the Olympic symbol]? 

E: I put a picture of the Oly mpics, I drew that
 because I like sport and I want to be in the 
Olympics one day. 
I: What about th ese ones? You've got ‚strops' and ‚saucy' [words]// 
E: //yeah I just thought that they were fun. 
I: And what about the giraffe? 

E: I liked 
Madagascar
 [animated film] the film and he
's my favourite character in it. 
I: And just finally how would y
ou usually describe y our ethnicity ? 
E: English white. 

I: Would you say English and white? 
E: I would just say English. 
I: OK that's brilliant. 

 

(D=Debbie, aged 13, female; I=interviewer) 


I: So is this one big collage or did 
you do two different collages for each section? 
D: One. 

I: Do you want to just go through each of the images and explain what you were trying 
to express with them? 
D: Um. 

I: You can start wherever you want. 
D: That one [image of a dancer] I just lik
e the picture and like sometimes I can be a bit 
over dramatic, it's the way that she's posing it's dramatic. 
I: And what about these colours, what are they for? 

D: Well I like colours, y eah I just
 like the colours they look nice. 
I: And you've got a picture of Kat Slater [
EastEnders
 character] there. 
D: Yeah, it's 'cause sometimes I can be a bit bitchy. 
I: And what's this one [cartoon image of a bubble]? 

D: I don't like the pollution. 



 
417
I: You don't like pollution. You've 
also got a picture of Peggy Mitchell [
EastE nders
 
character] looking like she is crying, what is
 that for, what are you trying to express? 
D: I don't know I forgot. 
I: OK and what about Little Mo [
EastEnders
 char acter ]? 
D: She's really happy person most of the time. 

I: And what about all of these images here 
because they are quite nature orientated, 
what are you trying to express with them images? 
D: Well with that owl it's like I like going fi
rst 'cause it makes you feel sort of like you 
don't have to do anything sort of thing a
nd the elephant 'cause I remember lots of 
things and then the that one 'cause I thought
 it looks a bit like my nose and then the 
seal because its flubbery and then the flower because of my name. 
I: And what about the mountain with the rainbow over it? 

D: I just liked it and it looked sort of steady sort of thing. 

I: Steady. 
D: M mm. 
I: And what about this [image of pink colours] because you've used// 

D: //oh, I was thinking about being in the army for a while but then I don't want to 
because you have to wear green and you get shot. 
I: And you' ve also got some words on there, can you explain why you've used them? 
You've used ‚what' and ‚one in a mill' 
and ‚independent'. What does the ‚what' 
mean? 
D: Well I like asking a lot of questions ab
out things and generally what or why. 
I: OK and what is this ‚one in a mill', why did you use that? 

D: Because, I don't know. 

I: You've got independent [word]// 
D: //because I like doing stuff by myself and being independent and I'm confident too. 
I: What about this picture here, is it a picture of a cross? 

D: Yeah. 

I: What is that there for? 

D: Well I'm a Catholic. 
I: You're Catholic. So is
 religion important to you? 
D: In some ways. 

I: When is it then and when isn't it? 

D: Well it's the same as all religions, it's 
not important when people are like going to 
argue over it and stuff but it is important to
 like believe in something otherwise your 
gonna just have a miserable life. 
I: Why do you think that, why do you think that you would have a mi serable life if you 
didn't believe in something? 
D: Because like if people believe in God and 
someone in your family dies then if they 
don't believe in nothing then there just not gonna think nothing about anything but if 

they believe in God then they'll be like a
ngry with him for a while but then they'll be 
like happy because they'll think the person will be with him. 
I: So do you think how you see yourself and how you think other people see you are the 
same thing or are there any differences? 
D: Well they're different some ways. 

I: In what ways are they different? 

D: Because like at school when I get shouted at I might seem like quiet and stuff but then 
to the people who know me I'd be like loud and stuff. 
I: So it's only the people who know
 y ou well who see every part of you? 
D: M mm. 

I: And just finally how would y
ou usually describe y our ethnicity ? 
D: Um English or Irish, oh yeah I like to th
ink Irish but I'm more English than Irish. 
I: Is your family Irish? 
D: My mu m. 

I: Where were you born? 



 
418
D: England. 
I: So why do you like saying I'm Irish? 

D: 'Cause I like Ireland more. 
I: You like Ireland more? 
D: Yeah. 

I: Why? 

D: 'Cause the people are nicer in general. 

I: The people are nicer// 

D: //yeah they're more friendly and it's just, it's just nicer over there. 
I: But if somebody asked you though, what would you usually say? 
D: Irish. 

I: You'd say Irish? 

D: Yeah. 

I: OK that's it. 
 
(B=Betty, aged 13, female; I=interviewer) 



I: Is this one big collage or two? 

B: It's sort of both. 
I: OK so it's a mixture. 
B: Yeah. 

I: Do you want to go thought the images and explain what you are trying to express 
with them? 
B: Where shall I start? 

I: You can start anywhere you want. Do you want to start with ‚say no to crap' 
[words]? 
B: OK yeah (laughs). I just sort of don't 
agree with people you know like bullyi ng like 
bully ing other people so it's sort of like if an
yone is ever horrible to them then just to 
like ignore it instead of like getting upset over it and that. 
I: What about these pictures? 
B: The star on the neck because it's sort of 
like symbols for rock and everything and like 
all, most rock stars have it and that's lik
e the kind of music I like and the Volkswagen 
because I' m a surfer and I just really like them. 
I: And you've also got a little ‚Children in Need' logo, what is that there for? 

B: I just agree with giving money fo
r charities and like that and like// 
I: //you disagree// 
B: //no I agree. 
I: You agree with giving money for charity. 

B: Yes. 

I: Are there any charities that you feel really strongly about? 

B: Live 8. 
I: Live 8. What is it about Live 8// 
B: //like it just shows they were getting people to like start sort of mentioning how 
important it was to like help the people in
 Africa and everything 'cause they got like a 
load of pop people and everything and show how// 
I: //but why do we need to help the people in Africa? 

B: Because they don't have like much money and they've got Aids and HIV and we 
could help stop it, well not st
op it altogether but we coul
d help like it not getting that 
far, like help people not dying. 
I: And you' ve got a picture of skateboarding th
ere, does that tie in w ith the van because 
you like surfing// 
B: //yeah I skate a bit. 
I: And there's an ipod, what's that// 
B: //I just really like music. 



 
419
I: And tying in with music you've got McFl
y and Green Day, are those the types of 
bands that you// 
B: //yeah// 
I: //enjoy listening to// 
B: //yeah. 

I: What is it about their music or them that you relate to? 

B: I don't really know I just, I just like their kind of music, I don't know but I play guitar 
as well and I don't really know, I just sort of like, why do other people like different 

music? 
I: Because sometimes you might identify with the pop star or you might think that they 
are singing about positive messages or that
 you might respect somebody because // 
B: //about Green Day I just think they are really cool and that because I'm not like into 
proper heavy rock I like sort of like pop rock
 and that's what they are and then they 
sort of like the way they act 'cause I've got
 the DVD and it's just I sort of like I think 
it's funny and I like that sort of stu
ff and then the same for McFly as well. 
I: OK and you've got Fearne Cotton, why is she there? 

B: Because I think she's real
ly funny and I like her style of clothes and everything as 
well like. 
I: What is it about her clothing and her style that you like? 
B: I think they 're just really cool 'cau
se they're sort of like rocky and that and 
everything and they're sort of like in 
the skating sort of like style as well. 
I: And what do these cameras mean? 

B: I love filming stuff and everything. 

I: And [image of cartoon rats]// 

B: Oh because in my band the rats are, a rat 
is our mascot and I just couldn't find any 
others like it. 
I: And what does that one stand for [3 Mobile monkey ]? 

B: I don't really know because it's like the opposite of me sort of thing because like I'm 
not evil so I still put it there, do y ou know what I mean? 
I: No I don't. 
B: It's sort of like, because I'm not evil and I'm the opposite to it I put it there. 
I: So do you think there's a difference between how you see yourself and how you think 
other people see you? 
B: Yeah I think there is but I think most
 people see me as a sort of like a surfing kind 
and like sort of a style that I'm my own st
yle and everything and I am and that's how 
I like it but I'm sort of skater as well and 
that's sort of the same because not many 
people, because I don't see like everyone in my
 class saying that they don't know I'm 
like a skater as well because most people see 
me as a surfer because my whole family 
are into that. 
I: Your whole family. 

B: Yeah we surf and everything and my sister is in sixth form and she's like she's a 
surfer. 
I: Right, and just finally how you would usually describe your ethnicity? 

B: English. 

I: You'd say y ou're English? 

B: Yeah. 

I: Always? 
B: Yeah I think so. 
I: Why do you say I'm English and maybe not I'm British? 

B: Because I'm not any of, I'm not like I'm not
 part Irish or Scottish or any thing like 
that I'm just, 'cause my parents and then 
my grandparents were all English so I'm 
sort of like that as well but because my 
granddad lives in Portugal but he's still like 
whole British. 
I: OK that's brilliant. 

 



 
420
(D=Dale, aged 13, male; I=interviewer) 


I: So Dale, are these two different collages? 
D: U m yeah. 
I: So shall we start with [how I see myself]// 

D: //yeah with the Arnold Schwarzenegger thing 
he's a really really good actor and I see 
myself as I'm really good at drama s o I think I can do it, and that [i mage of a lion 

with man's face] is to show that I'
m really timid yeah I'm quite shy. 
I: And you've got some trainers. 
D: That's 'cause I really like sport. 
I: And y ou've// 

D: //Colin Farrell that's because he does action films and I like action films so I would 
like to be an action actor. 
I: And on the other side, on how you think other people see you// 
D: //y eah that one's to show [image of a n old man ] that I'm quite crazy he's a really 
crazy person because they do stunts and stu
ff and that one is to show like um// 
I: //who is that? 

D: That's the guy off 
Little Britain
. 
I: Which character is that, Andy or Lo u? 
D: Andy I think. 
I: Andy. 

D: Yeah I kind of thought I was that beca
use I'm quite a good liar like sometimes I lie 
quite a bit and so like when people find out they get quite annoyed. 
I: Do you think lying is a good thing or a bad thing// 

D: //it's a bad thing. 
I: So why do you do it if it's a bad thing? 
D: It's 'cause sometimes if I do something bad 
I just can't really tell the truth about it 
'cause it's, mmm, you know. 
I: Because what? 

D: Because like I just don't like kind of 
person to see like, other people to see me like 
because of the bad things that I do. 
I: OK. 

D: So if I do something quite bad I might go bad but then I'm ok about it and I'm 
normal. I'm also really good at comedy and make people laugh quite a lot. 
I: So do you think how other people see you is how you see yourself, do you think they 
are the same or are they different? Do you think other people don't really know who 
you are? 
D: No people don't really know who I am really. 

I: They don't. 

D: No. 

I: Becaus e here you've put down that you can be quite timid [how I see myself], 
wherea s here [how I think other people see me ] y ou've put down crazy and they see m 
like two quite different things. 
D: Yeah I get that quite a lot, like I can't r
eally I just, I don't know, I just like when I'm 
at home I'm a different person or when I'm 
at school I'm a totally different person to 
that, I'm like the opposite. 
I: Which person do you prefer, the pers
on at school or the person at home? 
D: The person at home. 
I: The person at home. 

D: Yeah. 

I: And just finally how you would usually describe your ethnicity? 

D: Um probably I would just say English. 
I: English. 
D: Yeah or British. 

I: What one would you usually choose out of 
them two? Or what's the difference? 



 
421
D: Well I don't really know the difference, I 
do know like the difference but I like to be 
quite precise about everything so. 
I: So by say ing English you are being more precise? 
D: Yeah I'm being more precise. 
I: OK that's brilliant. 

 

(L=Leah, aged 13, female; I=interviewer) 



I: Are these two separate collages or one? 
L: Two different ones. 
I: So do you want to start with ‚how I see myself'. Do you want to just go through the 
images and explain what you are trying to express and represent with them? 
L: Well I chose the bears because I really lik
e animals and bears are one of my favourite, 
and I chose the baby to symbolise my niece who is a year old now, I chose an ipod 
because I like music and the ring because I like jewellery and I chose Leanne 
[
Coronation Street
 character] from the soaps because Leanne is my name so. I chose 
a smiley face because I'm happy and dolphin 
is my all time favourite animal and then 
Demi [
EastE nders
 character] because it's meant to symbolise my big sister and her 
baby who she's quite a young mum so, and I 
chose the doctor because I want to be a 
doctor when I get older. And the Capricorn because it tells you when my birthday is. 
I: Just going back to the picture of Demi, you said your sister is quite a young mum. 

L: Yeah. 

I: Demi was very young when she had the baby, some people were very upset because 
they don't like young mothers. What do you think about that issue? 
L: Well I don't mind young mothers, my sister
's not that young she's just in her twenties 
but she is still quite a y oung mu m but young mu m's are I think well, because of my 
religion I'm Christian, I think it's not very good unless your married. 
I: Is your sister married? 

L: No she's not, not at the moment but she's got a boyfriend and they are very close 
though. 
I: But would you have preferred it if she had got married first? 
L: Yeah I would have. 

I: You would have. 

L: But I don't hate her for it 'cause I'm not sure. 

I: OK let's move on to how you think other people see you. Do you want to just go 
through and explain the// 
L: //OK I chose a mouth a smiling mouth because I think other people think I'm happy 
because I'm always smiling. 
I: Right. 

L: And I chose make-up because I wear ma
ke-up when I'm out and I chose a phone and 
a car because well people sort of, don't 
know, I'm not sure why I chose them two 
really, can't remember. 
I: Do you think there is a difference between how you see yourself and how you think 
other people see you? 
L: Some of the things, yeah. 

I: What are the differences? 

L: Most of them except for them two. 
I: So the ipod and the jewellery, what about the other images, what do you mean? 
L: Well because I listen to music and I usually listen to music outside and inside, the 
people can see me with music and jewell ery. 
I: Oh right, but they don't know everything else about you, they don't know// 

L: //people that don't know me they don't 
know much about me, they don't know what I 
want to be or how I think. 
I: Are you happy that they don't know how you think or does that frustrate you? 

L: I wouldn't mind if they knew what I think or anything but, no I just wouldn't mind. 



 
422
I: And just finally how would y
ou usually describe y our ethnicity ? 
L: Um English maybe half German because my dad came from Germany and my 
grandparents. 
I: What would you usually say though? 
L: English usually. 

I: You'd say you are English. 

L: Yeah. 

I: So is your dad German? 

L: Well I don't think he is full German I

Jacob,13,"I: You just did one collage. 

J: Yeah. 
I: So is this just for how you see yourself or is a mixture// 
J: //mixture. 

I: Do you want to just go through the images and explain what you are trying express? 

J: Well that's my football team Tottenham a
nd that's my favourite player and that's 
why I like him. 
I: Who is it? 
J: Michael Carrick and he's like my sort of personality as well, often when you see him 
talking in like the interviews afterwards
 he's like sort of like me as well. 
I: In what way? 

J: I don't know I'm not sure, he's just, I do
n't know. The way he talks and everything 
what sorts of things he says is like comparable with me. 
I: OK. 
J: I just put that in because I was looking fo
r cricket and he's like a world cricket player 
I know and I like. 
I: Who is he? 

J: Muralitharan. 

I: Who? 
J: Muralitharan in the Sri Lankan team, cricket bowler. 
I: Oh. 

J: That because I'm Irish [flag ] and that's
 the Irish football team, Freddy Flintoff 
because he's like the main man for England th
e best cricketer and I love him I think 
he's brilliant, um penguins because there my favourite animal and I like how they 
like, I can't think of the word but I just like penguins. 
Lock, Stock and Two Smoking 
Barrels
 my favourite film and I just thought I would draw the English and Irish flag 
'cause I'm half Irish and half English. 
I: OK. 

J: They're my favourite colours and that's how 
I feel, sort of like not depressed and, like 
depressed would be a blacky and these are 
like happy sort of light colours. 
I: So y ou feel you're sort of in the middle so mewhere? 
J: No I'm like happy upbeat sort of person// 

I: //oh right// 

J: //like they are happy colours not like grey 
or anything like that. Zebra skin, I'm not 
sure, just a good contrast to go with it, I like zebra's. 
I: There's a Nike logo here and trainers, is
 this to show that you are quite sporty? 
J: Yeah yeah. 

I: What about 
Gladiator
 [film logo]? 



 
423
J: I'm not sure I just put that in, again 'cause I like the film 
Gladiator
. 
I: What about the number four and the Crazy Frog? 

J: Four is my favourite number and the Crazy Frog, I don't know why I put that in there, 
I don't know. 
I: So do y ou think how y ou see y ourself is the same as how y ou think other people see 
you? 
J: Yeah yeah. 

I: Do you think there are no differences? 

J: Not really. 
I: No? 
J: No. 

I: And if y ou had more time are there any other pictures that y ou would have put on? 

J: Yeah quite a lot. 

I: Like? 
J: Like I was trying to find probably pictur
es of people that will represent me as well, 
like mo re, I'm not sure// 
I: //if you could think of a couple of examples now, who comes to mind that you would 
have used? 
J: I can't think. 
I: No. 
J: If you go through a magazine I would see, oh I know that person and that's it oh he 
looks he's the sort of person I'm like, 
you know happy upbeat type of person. 
I: And just finally then, how would you usually describe y our ethnicity? 

J: If they asked me I would say English. 

I: You'd say you were English. 
J: Yeah. 
I: But you keep stressing that you are part Irish. 

J: Yeah I am part Irish but if someone said to me I would say I'm English but I am, you 
know what I mean like. 
I: So you don't ever tell people about the Irish// 
J: //no, yeah, but I am mainly English. 
I: Were you born here? 

J: Yeah. I was born in England but like my da
d is Irish my Nan's Irish and all that and 
my dad' s Nan and granddad that side of the family are all Irish so like, and my mum's 

side is all English so, and we have a lot of
 Irish people co ming down to visit us and

Alfie,13,"I: Can you explain what pictures you' ve used and what the pictures mean to you? 

A: Well, I see myself as a crossword because I'm always puzzled and confused and stuff 
and I se e my self a s a croc odile because I'm sc ary and I se e my self as a banana for 
some reason I forgot yeah. I see myself as a hamst er because I'm like quiet. I s ee 
myself as a cancer thing [starsign] because I'm a cancer and I done this picture of 

people kissing and stuff because I thought (starts laughing). 
I: Yes? 

A: I think other people see me yeah, I put a camera here because like I'm always kind of 
alert and I've got this crazy man staring 
up because I think I'm like scary again. I 
think people think I'm scary and I've got anot
her one of a guy with a moose on top of 
his head and that's just rea
lly freaky and stuff and that's how I think I am. And again 
I've just put another woman on it with a laptop. 
I: Why is the woman there? 

A: Everyone was doing it (laughing). 
I: OK. On this side of the collage, on 
how you think other people see you, you've used 
a picture of somebody, Ozzy Osbourne// 
A: //that's Ozzy Osbourne? 

I: That's Ozzy Osbourne, yes, who you said is scary and you've used pictures that you 
said are freaky, but you've not got much else in this section. 
A: Well that's because I reall y think that's how people see me. Alert, scary and freaky. 
I: Alert, scary and freaky. 

A: OK, not even the alert thing I was just trying to make myself look a bit good, about 
alert and stuff. 
I: What does this i mage [i mage of a guinea pig] mean? 
A: Well, it's a guinea pig or a hamster and guinea pig or hamsters are quiet and 
sometimes I'm usually quiet. 
I: On this side [how I see myself] you've sai
d you can be quite puzzled and that you are 
also quiet, but here [how I think other people see me] you're saying people see you as 

quite scary and freaky. Why do you think that people don't see the quiet side or 

puzzled side of y ou? 
A: Because I'm not usually quiet around other people, I'm usually quiet when I'm like at 
home or like with other friends that don't come to my school. 
I: I've also noticed that apart from Ozzy Osbourne, you haven' t used many pictures of 
media celebrities. Is there a reason for this? 
A: No, not really. 
I: No? 
A: Mainly because everyone took th e other pictures of celebrities before I got to th em. 

I: So if there were pictures th at you could have used to express what you were trying to 
say in both of these sections, what pictures would you add to this if you would add 

any? 
A: I' d probably put Kate Moss on this because she' s a druggie and (starts laughing), and 
I'm not sure what other celebrities I'd do. I don't really know any quiet celebrities. 
I: So why would you put Kate Moss on? 

A: Because she's a druggie, and druggies inspire me (laughing). 

I: Druggies? 

A: Inspire me (laughing). 
I: Why do they inspire you? 
A: Because they're always in trouble and I'm kind of a boy who's always in trouble. 

I: But you just said that you couldn't find 
any pictures of quiet celebrities because that's 
also how yo u see yourself. 



 
425
A: I see myself as loads of things. 
I: There see ms to be a clear definite difference between how you see y ourself and how 
you think other people see you. 
A: I' m not sure. 
I: You' re not sure? 

A: No. 

I: OK, just one last question. You said that you describe your ethnicity as Turkish 
Cypriot. Do you ever call yourself British? 
A: Yeah, I think that because I was born here
 that probably makes me British, I'm no t 
sure. 
I: What do you usually say? What would you usually describe yourself as? 

A: I'd probably say I'm Turkish Cypriot.

Andre,13,"I: Andre, would you like to explain what pictures you've used and why you have used 
them? 
A: I've got this one down [Jermaine Dafoe] 
because I, this player he plays the same 
position as me, a striker. 
I: Which player is it? 

A: Jermaine Dafo e. 

I: OK. 

A: I chose this one [mobile phone advert] b
ecause I like phones. This one [car ] because 
I like racing. 
I: Who is this [image of a black man]? 
A: I don't know but my brother looks a bit like him so may be one day I might look like 
that. 
I: Are there any qualities about Jermaine Da
foe that you think are similar to how you 
see yourself? 
A: I think that we both score, I don't know, goals and we're both black. 
I: Do you identify with him because he is black? 

A: Yeah, but it's not just that. 

I: So what else is it about him [Jermaine Dafoe] that you identify with? 

A: On the pitch he's hard-working like me. 

I: And is that something you see in yourself as well? 
A: Yeah. 
I: OK, let' s move on to this side [how I think other people see me]. Can you explain 
what the images mean? You've got a picture 
of a wolf here, why have you used that? 
A: Because so me people mig ht see me as quite lonely. 

I: Do you think you're lonely? 
A: No. 
I: Why do you think other people might think you're lonely then? 

A: I think, I just don't talk much. 

I: What about these pictures [Beyonce and Lucy Pinder] here? Why have you placed 
these here [how I think other people see me]? 
A: Because that's how my friends say they 
see me. Someone who, like if they've got a 
magazine with girls in it th
en they'l l just call me and show me because they say that 
one day I'm going to grow up to be a porn star or something like that. 
I: Is that how you feel? 

A: I' m not sure. 

I: Now I've noticed on this side [how you see yourself] you've got pictures of black 
men and on this side [how you think other 
people see me] you didn't use any images 
of black men. Is there a reason why you did that, or do you think that that is not 

something people think about when they see you? 



 
426
A: I don't know why I hadn't on that side [how I think other people see me]. 
I: If you had more time are there any pictures you would have liked to have put on the 
collage? 
A: Maybe an athlete. Maybe put an athlete on both sides. 
I: What would the athlete mean to you? What would it represent? 

A: Hard-working and being good. 

I: OK and how would you define your ethnicity? 

A: Half Trinidadian 

I: Half Trinidadian. Why only half? 
A: Because my mum was born in Trinidad and my dad was born here. 
I: Do you consider yourself British? 

A: I wouldn't say I'm British. 

I: You would or you wouldn't? 

A: I don't often say that I'm British. 
I: Is there a reason why you don't? 
A: Because there's some people that have
 British parents and grandparents, but my 
parents and grandparents are from the Caribbean. 
I: Do you think that if I changed the pict
ure of Jermaine Dafoe to, let's say David 
Beckham, do you think that it would still reflect part of how you see yourself or do 
you think that would change the overall m
essage and meaning of who you are trying 
to say you are? 
A: I don't think I would put David Beckham because he plays , unlike Jermaine Dafoe, 
he plays like different and in a different 
positions and he has got some qualities that 
Jer maine Daf oe don' t have. 
I: OK. Thank you.

I: OK, let's have a look at your collage. Would you like to just explain the images 
you've used for me? 
C: Yeah, I chose the image of Motorhead b
ecause I love heavy metal music and that's 
how I see myself as a heavy metal rocker. I used, well, the Gothic 3 monkey from the 

advert [3 Mobiles] because like, I don't 
want you like putting names on me, but a lot 
of people see me as a Goth, but I also see myself as a Goth so I'm pretty much in both 

spaces. 
I: What does being a Goth mean
 to you or what does it mean? 
C: Well to other people it means you worship the devil, but I don't think that, I just think 
you wear some clothes and your automatically a Goth, there you go. 
I: One interesting thing about your collag
e is up here you've written ‚I love life 
sometimes' with a time bomb. What does that mean? 
C: It's just sometimes life can be good and so
metimes life can be up in your face, so it 
like, sometimes I like my li
fe and sometimes I don't. 
I: What about this image of the person windsurfing? 

C: Well, I do a lot of extreme sports. I go down the skate park a lot to do skateboarding, 
and when it's summertime I go down to Swanage to do a bit of surfing and weight 

boarding and stuff like that. 
I: And [image of Green Day]? 
C: I used a picture of the three me mb ers 
of Green Day because they 're good friends and 
other people see me as a good friend. 
I: Now I've noticed that a lot of images th
at you have represent the meanings associated 
with gothic and sports, are there any imag
es there that reflect ho w you thin k other 
people see you? 
C: Yeah. 
I: Can you explain which ones? 



 
427
C: That one [advert for band auditions]. 
Well, it's a band audition and I think it's the 
only one that I could actually find with the word actually band in it so I'm in a band 

at the moment and people like see me in a band like with other people. 
I: And is that a picture of a cheetah? 
C: A cheetah or a leopard I'm not sure. 

I: And what does that represent [image of a cheetah]? 

C: That I stand out in a crowd. 

I: OK. 

C: That other people see me th at I stand out in a crowd. 
I: That's how you feel other people see you, th at you stand out. Is there a reason for 
that? 
C: Yes but I wouldn't like to say it. 

I: That's fine. 

C: I used the word ‚bloke' because I'm 
quite like, I speak in a cockney way. 
I: That's alright I speak in a cockney way. 
C: Yeah, that's why I used it (laughing). 

I: Now, I've noticed on this [how I see myself]
 you've also got ‚blimey she's fit' next to 
a nude woman. What does that mean and represent? 
C: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Because, well th
e blimey bit was supposed to be added to the 
body bit, the cockney bit, and the words ar
e supposed to be because, that's something 
I like (laughing). 
I: Do you think that the ‚bloke' thing and 
the nude woman, if other people see you that 
way do you think they see that as positive or negative? 
C: In what way? What do you mean by that? 

I: OK, you just said that you've used th
e word ‚bloke' because of your cockney accent 
and that you've also got a picture of a nude woman there which you said you like. 
Do you think that if other people were looki
ng at y ou and if they were qualities that 
they saw in you, i.e. he's a cockney blok
e who likes ‚birds', do you think other people 
would see that as a positive, like a good thing or a bad thing? 
C: Other people would see it as positive and ot
her people would see it as negative, it's 
like 50/50 really. 
I: What would influence what way they thought; whether they thought it was a good 
thing or a bad thing? What do you think? 
C: People might see it as a bad thing becau
se like, I don't know, they might take it the 
wrong way as if I'm a perv maybe, but in some other way people would see it as me 

being straight, so that's the positive. 
I: I've also noticed on your collage that there are no images of people who are not 
white. Are there any// 
C: //I'm not try ing to imply any thing by that. 

I: No, I'm not suggesting you are. But if you had more time// 

C: //yeah I would have 
I: Who would you have put for example [how I see myself]? 
C: I would have put, well if there was in a magazine, someone who I think who is a hero 
and like who has won the Nobel Peace prize b
ecause he stood up for what he believed 
in and that would be Martin Luther King. 
 So I probably would have put that down as 
well but I couldn't find it so there was no-one else except for, if I had found Tony 

Blair I would have put that there, I don't really like him but I would have used him 
because he's thinking and sometimes I make bad decisions and so does Tony Blair, 
but he also makes good decisions as well and so do I. 
I: OK. How would you usually describe your ethnicity? 

C: British, English. 

I: Would you say British or English mainly? 
C: Well, I would actually just say I'm a Londoner really. That's what I say to people 
like if they come up to me I say I'm a Londoner there you go. 
I: So that's what you would usua
lly say on a day-to-day basis?

Jimmy,13,"I: Let's start with the images on this side [how I see myself]. Can you explain why you 
chose them and what they represent? 
J: Well I've got pictures of the Gorillaz band because they're like my favourite band, 
like I sort of, I prefer their music to anyt
hing else it's like electronic rock and the 
eagle is just to show nature, that I like na
ture and I was born into a family of well my 
dad is sort of a climber, not like that extreme but like hill-climbing and stuff, and I've 

gone into I've been brought up into that wa
y and the eye is for like I'm aware, most 
of the time anyway. 
I: Aware of? 
J: My surroundings and stuff. And it's just a
nother one [i mage of a deer in a forest] to 
show nature like the eagle. 
I: What about this picture here of the man with the gun? 

J: That's not to say like guns are OK it was in
 a game magazine I didn't cut out all the 
whole thing. 
I: And is this all one picture or are they separate? 
J: That's separate. I put that in the middle because I know that I'm a 
Metal Gear Solid
 
fan and I like PlayStation stuff and everybody sees me as that// 
I: You know you're a// 

J: //
Metal Gear Solid
 fan like computers and stuff and everybody else knows I'm a big 
fan of it as well. 
I: And you've got the Gorillaz picture here again [how I think other people see me]. 
J: Most people know like all my friends know I'm into the Gorillaz. 

I: And you've also got the eagle again,
 so it's the nature theme repeated. 
J: Yes, yes. 

I: But here (pointing to child with gun and word ‚mosher')// 
J: //well, that's a separate part [child with
 gun] that's to do with that as well the 
computer games. Mosher is like a, it's a b
it like Carl said like a Goth but it's in a 
different way. It's more of a different styl
e, like electronic rock it's not heavy metal , 
but it's the way you dress, music you listen 
to, the way that you sort of style yourself 
out. 
I: So this is really interesting because it's 
like you've repeated pretty much the same 
images on both sides, but here yo u've used, on how you see yo urself, you feel that 
you are aware, but on this side [how I think other people see me] you haven't put it 

down. 
J: That's because I think that most people, 
because I am aware most of the time, I think 
people just thought I'm unaware because they see me that way all the time. 
I: So you think you are a lot more aware// 
J: //then people think I am. 

I: If you had more time to work on this 
what other pictures would you have put on? 
J: I probably would have put some more, 
I would have put like a PlayStation 2 or 
something like that because I always like that and I would put a couple more bands. 
I: Like which bands? 
J: I would have put Tupac on it because he's a good guy I look up to him. 
I: In what way is Tupac a good guy? 

J: Because he was like, he stood up for what 
he thought was right and then he got all the 
way through stuff and then he explained it 
in like songs and stuff and I thought that 
was really good. 
I: Because so me people sa w Tupac as a ba d guy because he was a bit of a gangster ty pe 
and he was involved with guns. 
 Didn't he end up getting shot? 



 
429
J: But the only reason he got shot was because he stood up for what he thought was 
right. I think that he was like really brave 
in what he did. I think he deserves a lot 
more respect than he probably does get.

few images here of different women. What
 does this head bit cut out on top of the 
other body mean? 
P: Some people just think I'm moody and I've got attitude. 

I: So some people think you're moody and that you've got attitude. 

P: Yeah. 
I: What do all of these different faces mean? 
P: That one says I'm confident [image of a girl in a yellow top]. 

I: Is that how you think other people see you, as confident? 

P: Yeah. Also friendly and funny 
[various images of women's faces]. 
I: What about this one [image of a black girl]? 

P: Pretty. 
I: And what about that one [image of a girl looking up]? 
P: I don't know, I just stuck it there. 

I: OK, you've also got ‚boring' [word]. 

P: Yeah, some people think I am boring. 

I: And what does this represent [image
 of a champagne bottle in a bucket]? 
P: That I'm lively. 
I: That you're lively? 

P: Yeah. 

I: Is ‚talk too much' [words] this side to? 

P: Yeah. 

I: Now you've got pictures of somebody funny and confident, but then also moody, 
attitude and boring. Do you think ot
her people see you as all those things? 
P: Yeah, that's what I think. 

I: OK let's go onto this side [how I see myself]. What do these images mean? Let's 
start with the girl in the jeans. 
P: Independent. 
I: Independent. 
P: Yeah. 

I: You've also though got the word ‚bitch' with an arrow going to the independent. 

P: (laughter) No it's not supposed to go to there. 

I: So that wasn't deliberate? 

P: Yeah. 
I: Do you think that this [independent] 
is a positive quality or sometimes people think 
it's negative? 
P: What independent? 

I: Yes. 

P: Positive. 
I: And what about these images [images of fashion items]? 
P: I just like going out and shopping and thing and buy ing clothes for me. 

I: So you like your fashion and accessories? 



 
431
P: Yeah. 
I: And you've also got the words ‚nice' and ‚star' and you've got ‚going-out' there. 
Now on this side [how I see my self], looking 
at it, it seems very positive but on this 
side [how I think other people see me] yo u've got ‚quiet', ‚boring', ‚moody', 
‚attitude'. Do you think that other people r
eally know who you are, what type of 
person you are? 
P: Most of them don't. 

I: Why do you think that that might be? 

P: Because I' m different around them. 
I: In what way? 
P: Quiet, bitchy. 

I: What was that? Bitchy// 

P: //to Kelly [pupil]. Sometimes I'm evil to people 

I: OK. If you could have used more images on your collage are there any pictures you 
would have liked to have been able put on? 
P: No. 

I: So you think this summaries, this sums up 
what were you were trying to express quite 
well. 
P: Yeah. 
I: That's great. So finally, how would you usually describe your ethnicity? 
P: I don't know. 

I: Last week you wrote// 

P: //I was black. 

I: Would you ever describe your ethnicity as British? 

P: No. 
I: Why not? 
P: I don't know. 

I: Were you born in this country? 

P: Yeah. 

I: So you always describe yourself as black? 
P: Yeah. 
I: And you would never describe yourself as British? 

P: I would, but I'm confused. Yeah I would.

Rachel,13,"I: Would you like to explain what the images mean here [how I see myself]? 

R: This means [image of a black model] I thi
nk I'm sexy, this one [i
mage of a black girl] 
Rachel is beautiful so I think that I'm beautiful and this one [image of a woman with 

a golf club] is showing that she's ac
tive and that's something that's me. 
I: And what about this side [how I think other people see me]? 
R: People think that I'm friendly [image of gi
rls] like this one here and this one [image 
of a man holding a woman] people think that I'm strong, and this one [i mage of a 

man with his mouth open ] people think that I'm a bit excited. 
I: Excitable, yes. 

R: And this one [i mage of a man with m
oustache] people think that I'm quite short-
temp ered and this one [image of a girl laughing] is funny, because I'm funny. 
I: They [o ther people] think you're funny. 

R: Yeah. 

I: Now I've noticed that you have strong 
and excitable and funny, but you've no t put 
any similar images in how you see yourself. Do you see yourself as all of these 
things or do you think that only 
other people see you as these things? 
R: I see myself as these things here [how I see myself], also these things [how I think 
other people see me]. 



 
432
I: So you see yourself really as both, the two sides can sort of merge. 
R: No, not really. 

I: Are there any things here that you th
ink you are that you think other people don't 
think you are? 
R: Yeah (pointing to image of a black model). 

I: So you think you're beautiful and you don't think other people think you're beautiful. 

R: Some people do. 

I: Some people do? 

R: Yeah. 
I: But not most people? 
R: Um, no. 

I: OK. If you had mo re time are there more pictures that yo u could have added to this, 
or that you would have liked to have added? 
R: I would have something that shows that I love animals. 
I: You love animals. So what picture could you have used to show that? 
R: Someone hugging a dog or something. 

I: OK, that's brilliant. And how did you describe your ethnicity? 

R: Caribbean. 

I: Caribbean. Jamaican? 
I: So you are Jamaican? 
R: Yeah, both. 

I: OK, because I've noticed here that yo u'
ve used images of black women for beautiful 
and sexy. If I took these pictures away and put pictures of maybe a white person or 

an Asian person here would it still mean the same thing? 
R: Yes, yes. 
I: It would? 
R: Yes. 

I: That's great. Thank you. 

 

(Z=Zahra, aged 13, female; I=interviewer) 

I: Let' s go through your picture. What do these images mean [how I see myself ]? 

Z: Well these mean what I think like how I see 
myself because they are all of the things I 
like, and these are how other people see me 
I: So we've got images like the butterfly, ‚good friend', ‚quiet' [words, how I see 
myself], and you think other people see you as quiet as well. What do th ese two lions 
mean? 
Z: They're my favourite animal. 

I: So is this one big collage that you've done or are they two separate? 

Z: Two really. Two separate. 

I: So which side is ‚Muslim' [word] on? 
Z: It's in the middle because I'm a Muslim. 
I: Do you th ink when it's on th is side [how I see myself], is it a good or a bad thin g? 

Z: It's a good thing. 

I: What about when it's on this si
de [how I think other people see me]? 
Z: It's a good thing as well. 

I: So you think that people see it [Muslim]// 
Z: //well y eah, unless they're racist. 
I: Unless they're racist. You've used a 
lot of pictures from nature, why is that? 
Z: I like animals . 

I: You like animals. 

Z: I' ve got quiet I thought mouse woul
d be good because mouses are qu iet. 
I: Are there any pictures that you would have liked to have put on your collage that you 
didn't have a chance to get?

Z: I would like to replace the se [all the wo rd
s on the collage] with pictures and I would 
have put Beyonce 'cause she's fashionable and independent and so am I. 
I: So everything that you've written you would have liked to have had pictures for then. 
Z: Yeah. 
I: OK and how did you describe// 

Z: //Mauritian. 

I: Mauritian. Were yo u born in this country? 

Z: Yeah. 

I: You were. Do you always say I'm Mauritian? 
Z: Yeah. 
I: You do. So is it important for you to say that? 

Z: Because most people think I'm from Pakistan but I'm not so. 

I: So it's important for you to make
 sure that they know you are Mauritian. 
Z: Yeah.

Aisha,13,"I: Do you want to explain what images you've chosen and why, and what do the 
pictures mean? (pause) OK, let's start with this side [how I see myself]. Why have 
you used the pictures of Kat and Little Mo [
EastEnders
 characters]? 
A: Becaus e I like soaps. 

I: OK, and what about the pictures above [images of a penguin and lion]? 

A: I love cats and I like animals. 

I: You've also got a tub of hair gel, what does that mean? 
A: That I like using hair gel sometimes. 
I: Underneath that you've got the word ‚religious' in a bubble. If there was a picture 
that you could use to represent that what would you put there? 
A: The Quran or something. 

I: Are these two separate collages or one big collage? 
A: That's separate. 
I: Because on how you think other people see 
you, you've got movies, chocolate and 
also ‚religious' [word] again. Looking at your collage, there's a lot more on how you 

see y ourself than there is the other side. Why is that? 
A: I didn't have time to finish it. 

I: So if you had more time how would you have finished it? 
A: I would have put more stuff on this 
side [how I think other people see me]? 
I: Like? 

A: Like 'cause I like watching TV and all of that kind of thing. 

I: I asked you last week how you would usually describe your ethnicity and you put 
Muslim.

Q: Yeah. And Manchester United are my favourite at sport, and 
Wizard of Oz

good movie, 
Gladiator

colours and things like that but, and I like cats. London obviously because I live in 

London. ‚Islam' [word] because it's my 
religion. ‚Respect' [word], don't know, 
'cause I think I actually respect people when 
they need it and stuff like that so I put 
that down. 
I: You've put it [respect] here. Do you 
think that's something people recognise in you? 
Q: Well, if I say my family yeah my family yeah, I don' t know about other people I 
don't care, about other people. 
I: So you respect your family? 
Q: Yeah, and other people obviously, but you know it does depend. 

I: You've put the words ‚Pakistan' and ‚Isla m' on this side. Are these two se parate 
collages? 
Q: No. 
I: So it's just one big one. 
Q: Yeah. 

I: Do y ou think that there is a difference between how y ou see y ourself and how you 
think other people see you then, or do you think// 
Q: //I don't know, I'm just one. 

I: What does this [image of the London Eye] mean? 
Q: This is a bit like yo u're trav elling by 
being as well like being like half-way through 
your life and things like that so here it ju
st represents London which is represented by 
colour like that, colours. 
I: And on your form you described your ethnicity as Pakistani British. Is that how you 
always describe yourself? 
Q: Well sometimes I do a bit of both sometimes I go a bit British but most of the time I 
do go a bit more Pakistani, but I do put normally // 
I: //What times would you do that? 

Q: I don't know, but the weird thing when people ask me I say I'm British Pakistani. 

I: And if you could have added any pictures to that [collage] what pictures would you 
have added? 
Q: Maybe a few more ani mal s becaus e I have lots of pets at home and some clothes to 
show I'm into fashion and am like my own person.

H: Sometime s I don't wear my scarf and sometimes I do.

I: But you were born in England a
nd your parents are from Pakistan?
