      "By Sokanon – Own work (Original text: I created this work entirely by myself.), CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=20706071Memes have been strongly criticised by biologists like Dawkins who believes they don't have the same properties as genes and therefore aren't a useful concept, other than describing the spread of internet jokes (or the effect on information of any infectious disease might be a more timely example).Dawkins himself says \"I think it‘s possible to have a science of cultural evolution\", then goes on to point out how hard it is to quantify memes and test their spread.  In his book The God Delusion, he says:  “It is socially useful to have an over-arching term, as a unifying discipline, for ‘the study of things that spread.’ But ‘viral marketing’ and ‘memetics’ are doing scientific and public understanding a disservice in lumping together such a mix of ill-matched study topics.\" ~ Richard Dawkins\n"
